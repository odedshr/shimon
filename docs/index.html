          <h2>Prologue: Memories</h2>
          <p>
            The problem with memories is the Gnomes, those who manage our brains, and their cassettes where all the
            impressions are stored for so many years. Everything is categorized by different subjects and every
            department has one (slightly stuttering) gnome in charge, which gets instructions from the chief-gnome:
            <i>“Retrieve a 'memory-cassette' and upload it (while the eyes are shut) to the subconscious”</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now what happens? Sometimes he finds the cassette without a hitch, sometimes he’s off to the loo or went
            abroad and no one answers.<br />
            Sometimes, he’ll suddenly wake you up in the middle of the night to whisper you the answer. Sometimes he
            doesn’t.</p>

          <h2>Childhood</h2>
          <p>
            "My first memories are from the age of four, back in 1924, in my parents’ textile shop in Berlin.
            As a new general store opened in our neighborhood, we packed all of our merchandise in big crates and moved
            to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuhof,_Hesse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neühof in
              Hessen</a>.</p>
          <p>
            Following the advice of a Jew named Steinberg my father planned to travel the nearby villages with his
            bicycle and sell to the local farmers. They were too eager to buy, but as this was Germany post the great
            war they didn’t have money and asked to pay with butter, eggs and cheese. We had plenty to eat but we ran
            out of money to buy more merchandise. Eventually we returned to Berlin two years later, poorer and without
            the big crates.</p>
          <p>
            My parents told me that in years to come but there were two incidents I can recall from that time as if
            they happened yesterday:</p>

          <p>
            As we lived in a big house, we hired a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goy" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">shiksa</a>” (non-Jew) maid to assist my mom with the house-chores.
            We didn’t have money either so she worked in exchange for produce. In the yard in front of the house (to
            this day I can draw an exact plan of the house, the yard and its surrounding) we had an underground septic
            tank, covered with rotten wooden planks. I was warned not to step on it but apparently the maid was not. We
            washed and scrubbed her thoroughly but the stench remained for a long time after.</p>

          <p>
            One evening, a nice “big-measured” lady who worked at a pub across the street ran to us all fussed as she
            witnessed my two-years younger brother, Hillel, who was three years old at the time, playing along the train
            tracks. Speedy trains would rush through from both directions and a mechanical gate would be lowered
            whenever the trains passed. My father took the bike, sat me on the rim and we rushed to the tracks. I still
            remember the beautiful scene of my brother playing with pebbles on the track as we heard the whistles of the
            nearing locomotive. I slipped through the gate’s bars and pulled my brother away. As the train passed we
            waved at the passengers and then went home, cheerful and ready for dinner.</p>
          <p>
            In 1926 I was enrolled in a gentile (non-Jewish) school near our apartment. The apartment was actually a
            store with rooms and a kitchen in the back that we shared with a kind-hearted elderly cobbler and his wife.
            They were also very poor. Nearby we had a plaza, or more accurately a park with trees and a space to play, a
            small hill (probably an old landfill) that we used in our plays during winter with make-shifts skis or a
            sled. The plaza was also used as the set-off point for communist riots against the Nazis. My parents had a
            market-stand and they travel from one market to the other to sell their products, mostly to other Jews.</p>
          <p>
            I was a good student and I studied easily. The teachers were cruel and whipped us painfully with a wooden
            stick. While the priest taught the gentile students about Jesus, the Jewish students attended the class of a
            Jew named Barron who taught physics to the senior students while the younger students did their homeworks.
            He was a real sadist and he exploited the children and sent them to the bank to execute transactions on his
            behalf.</p>

      <article class="page">
        <section class="page_content">
          <p>
            Our parents returned late every evening. After eating lunch, the cobbler’s wife would take us to the
            synagogue, dressed nicely and we would come back to a tasty meal mother would fix for us. On Sundays we
            would walk the old marching-park that has been converted to a common and we flew kites we my father helped
            us build. Occasionally we would visit relatives that had their own stores. Our lives were peaceful but that
            too came to an end. In the first years, I didn’t feel any antisemitism.</p>
          <p>
            The year was 1928 and the winter was extremely cold. Schools shut as there wasn’t enough coal for heating.
            Hillel and I took a small cart to the train-tracks where coal from <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Silesia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Upper
              Silesia</a> was offloaded. Taken, borrowed or straight-forward stolen, we kept our home warm. We used the
            cart to bring left-over cardboard from a nearby factory and cut soles using tailor’s scissors. We glued fur
            leftovers, trimmed neatly, sorted and paired. The entire family worked around the table - one drawing
            another cutting and someone using the Bärenkleister glue - hard work and production was slow - but it sold
            very well. It kept on for quite some time until it was forbidden for Jews to sell in the market.</p>
          <p>
            Then Hillel and I would scour the streets, looking for coins that fell in basement-windows shafts and
            occasionally we would find a coin or two to make the search worthwhile but more
            often than not we didn’t look where we’re going and we would bang our heads on open windows and signs.</p>

            As winter passed school reopened. A kid in the class didn’t like Jews and harassed me in his tongue. A day
            before summer-break I couldn’t stand it anymore and I punched him in the face. I bled a bit but I hurt my
            arm greatly. I was afraid to go home. I spent some time watching the underground-train being dug but
            eventually I had to return home. During the meal I had to use the other arm to lift the hurt one. We went to
            the doctor in the afternoon who decided it was merely a skin condition and instructed us to put cold towels.
            That made it even worse. We managed to get an x-ray and saw it was broken. I had a cast throughout
            summer-break and it healed nicely.</p>
          <p>
            We moved to an apartment on the fourth floor of an old building. We learned to slide the rail to get down
            quickly. In the new school I met children who were members of “<a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habonim_Dror" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HaBonim</a>”
            (“The builders" in Hebrew) - a Jewish Youth movement organized by students who mostly came from Poland.
            This was the beginning of the “brainwash” to build our future in Palestine and become a part of the
            upcoming Jewish state. Our parents weren’t thrilled of the idea. They believed in Germany and the German
            people.</p>
          <p>
            When I was ten I transferred to a <a
              href="http://www.jg-berlin.org/en/institutions/education/jewish-high-school.html" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Jewish High-school in Große Hamburger Straße</a> and had a good time there. We
            learned Hebrew, English and French. I still remember what I learned there to this day. At that time I
            learned to ride the bike and I would cycle to school, although it was tricky to bring them up to the fourth
            floor every day.</p>

          <p>The zeitgeist has has changed and there were more riots and street-fights between communists and nazi were
            more
            common.</p>
          <p>One day, we received notice from the police that my eight-year old brother was picked up at a communist
            demonstration and now awaits us to be picked by us at a distanced police station.</p>
          <p>He just enjoyed the adventure.</p>
          <p>At one time while trying to convince him to come back home with me I promised to give him a wrist watch
            once
            we’re home.</p>
          <p>To his dismay, when we got home I tied a big alarm clock on his wrist.</p>
          <p>He was so furious he chased me around the house with a knitting-needle trying to stab me but ended up
            accidentally jamming into the door.</p>

          <p>He and I had many other mischiefs.</p>
          <p>One time we tried our luck using a big sewing machine; being too small to man it alone we took positions -
            I
            was in charge of the pedals while he directed the needle at the top.</p>
          <p>We decided to call it quits when the needle went through his palm.</p>

          <p>Another time, he went to cut his hair at the barber a week after I did, but since we looked alike the
            barber
            just couldn’t fathom how my hair has grown so long in the short span of a week.</p>

          <p>Back then it was a new invention (replacing the <a

            provide.</p>
          <p>We never lacked for vigor and we’ve collected stuff other people wanted to to get rid of.</p>
          <p>Home was traditionally Kosher.</p>
          <p>We would go to the synagogue on the Sabbath and we separated between dairy and milk.</p>
          <p>We celebrated all the holidays, kept in touch with all the family and we walked a lot.</p>
          <p>The atmosphere in the house was positive.</p>
          <p>We didn’t fight and we did everything together.</p>
          <p>Father played the violin and the harmonica when he was in a good</p>

          <p>During the summer we went to a summer camp outside the city, sponsored by the then-very-active Jewish
            community

          <h2>The Training Farm</h2>
          <p>Between 1930 and 1938 many rich Jews still believed that Nazism is “just a phase” that will soon die out.
          </p>
          <p>In the meantime we learned in “HaBonim” everything about settling in the holy land and we didn’t doubt that
            one
            day we’ll go there and join the operation.</p>

          <p>In 1933 things got worse- Hitler rose to power and openly declared he’ll get rid of the Jews.</p>
          <p>Migrating to the British-governed Palestine required a visa and those were scarce.</p>
          <p>Visas were allocated for rich people (which cost £1000), for tradesmen (£250) and a special visa for poor
            people who had agricultural training was subsidized by “<a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Agency_for_Israel" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">The
              Jewish Agency</a>”.</p>

          <p>In 1934, at the age of 13.5 I got an opportunity to join the <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakhshara" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">training-farm at
              Gut
              winkel</a> (owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gershom_Schocken" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Gershom Shoken</a>, who later established the Israeli newspaper “HaAretz”).</p>
          <p>I left school and went to become a farmer.</p>
          <p>We lived in a bubble-like isolation from the surrounding hostile world - 50 boys and girls from all across
            Germany.</p>
        </section>
      </article>
      <article class="page">
        <section class="page_content">
          <p>The instructors from “HaBonim” came along with us, and we also had a Hebrew teacher that came from
            Palestine.
          </p>
          <p>We had fields, cows, pigs, chickens, fruit trees, green houses, preservatives factory and a workshop that
            served the farm.</p>
          <p>In the first couple of months I worked in weeding out the fields and picking worms and slugs from the
            cabbages.</p>

          <p>At the beginning of every month we’ve been given new assignments - to the cowshed, the stable and the farm.
          </p>
          <p>A few “Goyim” (non-Jew men) worked on the farm and I still remember the Werkstatt (workshop) manager - Paul
            Marks.</p>
          <p>We got along well and I learned a lot from him.With the exception of a few weeks I worked in the cowshed
            and
            with the</p>
          <p>horses I spent the better part of the next two years in the workshop. It was a very interesting place.</p>
          <p>With 450 Morgen (~112 km) with nearly 100 trainees and staff members, animals and machinery and always
            something break</p>
          <p>and something to be manufactured, build a new building, fix the roof or the tractor.</p>
          <p>For most jobs, professionals from the outside were invited (surprisingly they still worked for Jews).</p>

          <p>The farm had a good reputation and they all knew the manager <a
              href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gerson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gerson</a> by
            his
            first name Martin and respected him.</p>
        </section>
      </article>
      <article class="page">
        <section class="page_content">
          <p>I was tasked to shadow them and learn their trade and secrets.</p>
          <p>This way I learned how to build a roof; fix a barrel, to dismantle the tractor, to shoe a horse and more,
            but
            this has happened long after my small rebellion.</p>
          <p>The 7am alarm went and we all gathered outside, waiting to receive our monthly assignment.</p>
          <p>For the third time, I was assigned to the workshop.</p>
          <p>I sat by the sawing table but refused to work.</p>
          <p>I told Marks I’m on a strike because I came to Gut Winkel to become a farmer and not a handyman.</p>
          <p>He didn’t answer, he just went to the office across the yard and informed Martin that I don’t want to work.
          </p>
          <p>After a short moment he returned and instructed me to go to the office.</p>
          <p>There, Martin explained to me calmly that the farming skill I would pick up easily but becoming handyman
            will
            be much more useful for me in Palestine (from what he gathered at his visits there).</p>
          <p>So I conceded and returned to work.</p>
          <p>Needless to say, he was right.</p>

          <p>One time, my friend Konrad and myself arrived late to dinner from loading heavy bags of coal and potatoes
            and
            announced to the girls we’re hungry and they should prepare our dinner.</p>
        </section>
      </article>
      <article class="page">
        <section class="page_content">
          <p>Even though I was as thin as a stick, I had an insatiable appetite and so I made a bet with Konrad that I
            will
            stay hungry even after he will have enough and the girls would call it quits.</p>
          <p>In the kitchen, one girl washed the potatoes, another peeled, a third girl grated them and a girl named
            Ilana
            was in charge of making the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latke" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">latkes</a> over the hot stove, while the last girl was in charge of serving us.
          </p>
          <p>In one of her rounds, the girl heard me asking Konrad for his count and he replied he only ate 20 so far.
          </p>
          <p>In the kitchen exhausted Ilana asked how many more people need to be served and her friend replied that
            there
            are only two boys.</p>
          <p>“Well! Do they have a hole in their stomach through which all the latkes fall from?!” cried Ilana and her
            friend told her about our bet.</p>
          <p>She became so furious she stormed out of the kitchen and gave me a ringing slap across my face, to the
            laughter
            of everyone around.</p>
          <p>Years later, I met her at her home in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HaZore%27a" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Kibbutz HaZorea</a> and asked her about the incident but she didn’t remember
            anymore.</p>

          <p>We usually worked during the morning hours and in the afternoon we had lectures and studies.</p>
          <p>In the evenings we sang and danced and were completely oblivious to the outside world.</p>
          <p>When I visited Berlin I saw the attitude towards the Jews had deteriorated. I saw signs “die juden sind
            unser
            unglück! Kauft nicht bei Juden!” (“The Jews Are Our Misfortune! Don’t buy from Jews!”).</p>

      <article class="page">
        <section class="page_content">
          <p>I saw Party members singing “When Jewish blood spurts off the knife, things will be twice as good”.</p>

          <p>During those two years I rarely visited my family in Berlin.</p>
          <p>Hillel visited me once, worked shirtless in the orchid hoping to get a tan but ended up sunburning his
            back.
          </p>
          <p>The next morning the cotton clinged to his raw skin.</p>
          <p>The manager’s wife, a kind-hearted woman, took care of him and he returned home safe and sound.</p>

          <p>Many unemployed city-folks joined the party while the village people weren’t sure how to process it so the
            attitude towards us was mostly neutral.</p>
          <p>The two years went by quickly but we still didn’t get the visa for Palestine.</p>

              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grüsen in Hessen</a> for additional training - running a farm on
            our
            own and with no adult supervision.</p>
          <p>On Passover we got a vacation for a week.</p>

          <p>After a day of train-ride we arrived in the late afternoon to the <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giessen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gießen</a>.</p>
          <p>The bus to the village, which departs once a day, was long gone.</p>
          <p>We walked for ten kilometers with suitcases in our hands.</p>
          <p>It got dark early that season.</p>

          <p>We walked alongside the road, and whenever we saw a structure (usually a barn) we shouted “Kibbutz</p>
          <p>Hagashama!” (“Fulfillment”) but were left unanswered.</p>
          <p>Later we arrived down a street and saw a sign for “Grüsen”.</p>
          <p>Two soldiers passed by on bicycles and we asked them for directions but they ignored us.</p>
          <p>Luckily, a maid heard us and offered to lead us the way.</p>
          <p>We went up the stairs in the nearest yard to the first floor and found the lot sitting around a long table
            having dinner.</p>
          <p>We joined them, but after only a few moments we heard the noise of a motorcycle in the yard and then
            banging
            on
            the door - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestapo" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Gestapo</a>! (Nazi secret police).</p>
          <p>A thug came in with a leather hat and asked if new people had arrived.</p>
          <p>A guy named Harry replied that two men have arrived.</p>
          <p>The thug asked if they registered at the town’s council as required by law, which we still haven’t and the
            thug
            replied he is going to arrest us.</p>
          <p>Everyone brought us something - a loaf of bread wrapped in paper, a kettle, a thick coat - so we wouldn’t
            miss
            anything during our prison time.</p>
          <p>The commissar took us out to the stairs and announced - “attempt to escape and I’ll shoot!”.</p>

          <p>He went back inside and as we heard the waves of laughter we knew we'd been duped.</p>
          <p>We went back in and met the “Commissar” who was one of the group - Aryeh Levenstein.</p>
          <p>Back then, in 1936 we didn’t take the Nazi regime too seriously.</p>
          <p>After we left, in 1937 the Gestapo really came - broke all the furniture, killed a few people and scattered
            the
            rest.</p>
          <p>The land we worked on belonged to old Jews whose children have left to America or Palestine while their
            parents
            found it difficult to leave their estate behind.</p>
          <p>This was, eventually, confiscated by the Nazis and they paid for their stubbornness with their lives.</p>

          <p>We were 26 boys and girls, from 16 years old to 25, all waiting for the visa and eager to immigrate to
            Palestine.</p>
          <p>The area around the farm was very arid with inaccessible plots of poor soil on sloppy mountains.</p>
          <p>We used the cows to work the land, and we milked them too.</p>
          <p>Only one farmer had a horse.</p>
          <p>The produce, hay and wheat,</p>
          <p>we carried on our backs to lower ground and from there we pulled wagons to the yard.</p>

          <p>It was very primitive.</p>
          <p>For us, coming from a modern farm it was very weird that people can be so outdated.</p>
          <p>The grain was harvested with scythes from two o’clock at night as dew began to form until nightfall of the
            next
            day.</p>
          <p>I trained to use the scythe and to prepare it for work. On top of working the land and taking care of the
            cattle, we traveled for up to 50km away to offer help to Jewish farmers who were forbidden from hiring
            German
            workers.</p>
          <p>We did everything willingly and joyfully.</p>
          <p>The girls worked at the kitchen and once a week we would slaughter a goat we bought from the gentiles, so
            we
            also had meat.</p>
          <p>The cows supplied us with milk and cheese.</p>
          <p>We had a few fruit trees - apples and pears and we made preservatives and jams.</p>
          <p>The farm’s compound included a synagogue and the old Jews would worship there on the Sabbath, but they
            didn’t
            even have a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minyan" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">minyan</a>” (ten people required for worship).</p>
          <p>We would fill up the ranks for 3 marks a heard.</p>
          <p>We sat in the synagogue with detective stories until the service ended.</p>
          <p>We were in good terms with our gentile neighbors and we helped them out during the harvest.</p>

          <p>At the end of the work days we would sit down with them for respectful yet vocal conversations. </p>
          <p>They didn’t want the new regime (at least at the start).</p>
          <p>When Nazi official came to count their stocks they hid chickens under the bed, they told us.</p>

          <p>The village had a communal oven and once a week bread was baked.</p>
          <p>All the women would gather around the big over and the men would supply the fire-wood.</p>
          <p>Most of the matchmaking happened there.</p>
          <p>We also had a plot of forest and we sold wood to the villagers and this provided income throughout the
            snowy
            winter.</p>
          <p>In the spring we were busy preparing the vegetable gardens and the fields so there wasn’t much time to
            think.

          <p>While the plants were growing I was offered a bet to cycle 500km to Berlin in 24 hours.</p>
          <p>The real challenge was a really high mountain range.</p>
          <p>One of the guys once traveled the road so he instructed me about the different parts.</p>
          <p>I prepared a good set of bicycles, a watering can, a loaf of bread, a sausage and three marks.</p>
          <p>My task was to arrive in Berlin by midnight the next day and send a pre-written postcard to win 10 marks.
          </p>
          <p>I set off and of course I took a wrong turn which cost me 30km.</p>
          <p>I arrived late to the foot of the Harz mountain and it started getting dark already.</p>
          <p>I pushed the bicycle 12km up the mountain.</p>
          <p>Halfway up I met a group of Dutch bikers near a fountain, they invited me to spend the night but I didn’t
            have
            time and I continued my ascent.</p>
          <p>Not far from the holiday town Braunau I stopped to rest by a stream.</p>
          <p>I tied my bicycles to my arm using the trousers belt.</p>
          <p>As soon as I fell asleep I felt someone licking my face.</p>
          <p>A big hound dog stood next to me along with a forest ranger who invited me to his cabin.</p>

          <p>We chatted a bit, I told him about my situation and we said our goodbyes.</p>
          <p>I should mention I wore short leather-trousers, similar to the ones worn by the <a

              rel="noreferrer noopener">Hitlerjugend</a>
            (“Hitler Youth” youth movement) so I didn’t cause any suspension.</p>
          <p>I woke up before sunrise and realised my watch stopped as I forgot to wind it the night before.</p>
          <p>I washed in the stream and continued my climb to the peak.</p>
          <p>The descent was 42km of turns through the forest without paddling even once.</p>
          <p>At some point I came across a man who was busy cracking open small vaults.</p>
          <p>He offered me 50% for my help but I declined. Quickly I reached Halberstadt at the foot of the mountain.
          </p>
          <p>I was tired and hungry.</p>
          <p>I ate some of my food and at that point I made a fatal mistake: I held onto a small lorry and progressed
            quickly.</p>
          <p>The end came soon enough though - the driver saw me through the mirror and pushed me off the curb into a
            ditch.
          </p>
          <p>I was safe but the front tyre slipped out of the wheel and had a 10cm tear.</p>

          <p>I didn’t have a spare so I was reluctant to stick all my patches one next to the other and pump the air
            without
            checking it out first.</p>
          <p>Surprisingly it worked and I could continue my journey.</p>
          <p>In the meantime I ran out of food.</p>
          <p>In the next town I bought a new tyre and more patches and so I ran out of money as well.</p>
          <p>In the afternoon I arrived at the Havel river and I traded two stamps for 2 old buns (thanks to the leather
            trousers).</p>
          <p>I dipped them in the river (that was still clean back then) and continued cycling with revived energy.</p>
          <p>By nightfall I reach Potsdam.</p>
          <p>I don’t fully remember the last leg of the journey, I must have dozed off while cycling the busy roads but
            by
            half an hour before midnight I arrived at our home and I put the postcard in the mailbox.</p>

          <p>Luckily the gate was open as we lived in the back wind.</p>
          <p>It was a bit challenging to wake them up without scaring them too much but the rejoice was great as they
            didn’t
            know I was coming.</p>
          <p>We didn’t have a phone back then.</p>
          <p>I spent a few days at home with all the books and we visited all the relatives.</p>
          <p>We didn’t talk about leaving Germany.</p>

          <p>The year was 1937, life was hard, living from unemployment benefits, no jobs and more and more brown-shirts
            marching the streets and Nazis with antisemitic cries.</p>
          <p>After a few days I headed back.</p>
          <p>My brother Hillel escorted me with the bike all the way to Potsdam and from there on I was on my own.</p>
          <p>But not for long. </p>
          <p>A Hitlerjugend member joined me and was happy to have a partner for the journey.</p>
          <p>He even suggested that we would spend the night at a Hitlerjugend hostel.</p>
          <p>It wasn’t easy but I managed to get rid of him.</p>
          <p>My father handed me a letter to bring to a family relatives I never met in Halberstadt.</p>
          <p>They welcomed me to their home but because of the registration-law I couldn’t stay more than a day or two
            and
            I
            couldn’t take my mind off thinking how I would carry the bike up 42km I easily freewheeled.</p>
          <p>The problem resolved itself easily - the uncle gave me 10 marks (a generous amount at the time).</p>
          <p>I loaded the bicycle and myself on a train and leisurely rested the rest of the way.</p>

          <p>Everyone was happy to see me safe and sound and I won the 10 marks as the postcard arrived in the meantime
            with
            the midnight post’s seal.</p>

          <p>Harvest has begun and we were very busy.</p>
          <p>One time an emissary of the Jewish Agency (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giora_Yoseftal"
              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Giora Yoseftal</a> who later became an Israeli minister) came to
            examine us in preparation for the Aliya (immigration to Israel).</p>
          <p>It went smoothly.</p>
          <p>In the evening Arye Levenstein came with the motorcycle and arrested Giora in the shed.</p>
          <p>At night he approached the window and told him: Giora, you need to flee, I’ll help you.</p>
          <p>But he refused, believing he'd manage to bail on his own.</p>
          <p>In the morning we released him and told him the joke but he didn’t laugh.</p>
          <p>In autumn, we traveled to the county-city Haina to get a passport. The clerk was very nice and wished us
            good
            luck in the Holyland.</p>

          <p>In the beginning of December 1937 I sold my bike and in exchange I bought a fat goose to bring home as a
            farewell gift.</p>
          <p>The Berlin Jewish community organised gear for our departure - clothes, shoes and raincoats.</p>
          <p>Finally we needed a police approval stamp to leave Germany and take money with us.</p>

          <p>Usually the permit was for 10 marks but I was allowed 60, I’m not sure why.</p>
          <p>Maybe they thought I had a pretty face.</p>
          <p>I didn’t have 60 marks and didn’t need so much money anyhow.</p>
          <p>We said our goodbyes without too much drama, not knowing we’ll never meet again.</p>

          <p>A few words about my uncle Paul Rees.</p>
          <p>Paul was my mother’s brother.</p>
          <p>They lived outside the city in a luxurious neighborhood.</p>
          <p>He was an executive in a big bank and played tennis.</p>
          <p>Hillel and I occasionally visited them.</p>
          <p>And upon arrival we were sent to bathe to make sure we were clean at their home (The maid would murmur that
            even the</p>
          <p>Mother-superior would bathe once a year, if she didn’t really need to).</p>
          <p>Before leaving for Palestine my mother sent me to talk to him and have him convince me not to go.</p>
          <p>He talked to me genuinely and described the situation in Germany from his point of view.</p>

      <article class="page">
        <section class="page_content">
          <p>He showed me a map of Palestine - a desert land without enough water, the highest mountain is merely 350m
            (Mount Carmel) and with the exception of some oranges nothing grows in this Malaria and cholera infested
            land.
          </p>
          <p>In hindsight he was right in every word but wrong in many things.</p>
          <p>We never heard from him again.</p>
          <p>I know his only daughter, Erika Rees, arrived in Ein-Vered (in Israel) but we never managed to get in touch
            with her as she vanished as well.</p>

          <p>On December 27, 1937 at 21:00 the train From Anhalter headed on its way to <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trieste" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trieste</a>
            (Italy),
            and from there we took an Italian boat called Jerusalem.</p>
          <p>The train ride was very pleasant. Aside from the two carts we used, the rest of the train was empty as the
            carts were being moved back to Italy.</p>
          <p>Many of us knew each other from the training farm, and we easily befriended with the rest of the people who
            came from other similar farms.</p>
          <p>We found in the carts sweets, chocolate and sweet drinks the Berlin Jewish community prepared for us.</p>
          <p>Many of these we never tasted before, I guess they were Italian sweets.</p>

          <p>When we arrived at Trieste we learned the ship had already left and we needed to wait for another week
            until
            it
            returned from Haifa.</p>

          <p>We were accommodated at Bet HeHalutzim (Pioneers House) in Via dolorosa and from there we toured Trieste,
            visiting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramare_Castle" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Miramare castle</a> and other sites.</p>
          <p>Time went by quickly.</p>
          <p>We celebrated the beginning of the new year in town but at midnight the 20 Lira coins went obsolete and
            they
            refused to accept our coins.</p>
          <p>We didn’t have any other money to pay at the restaurant and for the Chianti wine bottle we bought to bring
            with
            us to the boat.</p>
          <p>Eventually we convinced them to accept the coins.</p>

          <p>On January 5th, 1938 we boarded the ship and left Italy.</p>
          <p>We were asked if we wanted Kosher food as the ship had a Jewish chef, We agreed.</p>
          <p>While touring the ship we met with the fat Jewish chef who welcomed us joyfully with various treats.</p>
          <p>The weather was friendly but over time the sea became rough and everyone got sick.</p>
          <p>Two other guys and I didn't get seasick, so we toured from one dining hall to the other and the waiters
            were
            happy to serve us.</p>
          <p>We ate a lot.</p>
          <p>On the last night we asked for glasses to share our wine with everyone but it was very sour and no one
            wanted
            to drink it.</p>

            ride
            to Kfar Yehoshua.</p>
          <p>Me and my two friends decided to go out to the street and explore a bit.</p>
          <p>We didn’t step more than 50 steps when a man came to us and asked if we were crazy (good thing I understood
            a
            little bit of Hebrew).</p>
          <p>He told us there were hostilities (when weren’t there hostilities in Palestine?) and we were heading
            straight
            towards the arab market.</p>
          <p>We turned back as we were scared and we didn’t have to take unnecessary risks on the first day.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, we later learned, our heavy cargo was loaded onto the train and it arrived with us to the
            village.</p>
          <p>At two o’clock we went to board the train.</p>
          <p>We saw signs forbidding flower- picking during the ride.</p>
          <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz_railway" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hejaz
              Railway</a> train was so slow apparently that it was custom that people went off the train to pick flowers
            and
            then rushed back up.</p>

          <p>The train rode through Kibbutz Yagur, Kiryat Haroshet and eventually Kfar Yehoshua - Tel Shamam.</p>
          <p>The train ride took a lot of time and its schedule wasn’t fixed.</p>

          <p>At the station we saw the village folks with the mule ridden wagons, as the mules were rolling in the mud.
          </p>
          <p>A day prior to our arrival was the first rain of the winter.</p>
          <p>The soil of Kfar Yehoshua was black, deep and needed very little rain to turn to a knee-high mud swamp.</p>
          <p>Seeing the mules rolling I feared something bad had happened.</p>
          <p>I jumped from the train straight to the mud with my leather polished boots but the folks assured me that
            this
            is a normal behaviour.</p>
          <p>I murmured in German that a German horse would never dare to behave this way.</p>
          <p>This was quoted throughout the village a long time after.</p>

          <p>With joint effort we loaded our heavy gear on the wagons and traveled to the village center on a rock-paved
            road that was used to ship the daily milk via the train to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tnuva"
              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tnuva</a> at Haifa.</p>
          <p>We assembled in the school that was built especially for us and heard welcoming words from the village
            members.
          </p>
          <p>Eliyahu Shitzer Amitzur (who worked at his farm even at his 100th birthday) translated their words to
            German.

          <p>I answered with broken Hebrew was published in the newspaper the next day.</p>
          <p>When the speeches concluded, they read out a list of pairs - each boy or girl and their adopting village
            member.</p>
          <p>We were then taken, along with our luggage to our prospective homes.</p>
          <p>I was welcomed to the home of the Dov Rukhni family - the wife Fruma, a three year old daughter Shulamit
            and
            the brother in law who worked as a constable for the British police.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, I knew a little bit of Hebrew so we managed to communicate straight away.</p>
          <p>The wife, a plump young woman who talked in Yiddish was also a new immigrant.</p>
          <p>The house had two rooms and a kitchen shack.</p>
          <p>I was treated with a variety of foods I never tasted - bitter olives and sweet <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halva" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halva</a> along with
            an
            omelette from two eggs (as the chickencoop had plenty of broken eggs).</p>
          <p>Shortly after Dov said he needs to go harvest some hay for his cows.</p>
          <p>I suggested I would join him as I have mastered the scythe and just before leaving Germany I took in my bag
            a
            wetstone and a “scythe key”.</p>
          <p>I now took those two items with me as we took the mule-driven wagon to the oat plot at the edge of the
            field.

        <section class="page_content">
          <p>Straight away I could tell the scythe was blunt and not calibrated.</p>
          <p>The mule started grazing as Dov took the scythe and started harvesting.</p>
          <p>Being uncalibrated the scythe kept getting stuck in the ground.</p>
          <p>I suggested doing it but not knowing me Dov feared I would break the blade.</p>
          <p>I told him I have little money left and if I’ll break it I’ll buy him a new scythe.</p>
          <p>I sharpened the blade and calibrated the scythe as he stood awestruck.</p>
          <p>When I started cutting he didn’t say anything and instead just took the pitchfork and started loading the
            wagon.</p>

          <p>On our way back we met the neighbour Glick as the path was shared to save land.</p>
          <p>Dov told him as we passed “The boy can harvest!”.</p>
          <p>After milking and dinner (a two eggs omelette again), we walked to the diary collection point to deliver
            our
            milk.</p>
          <p>There I met Shimon Doron who has been with me in the training farms for the past three years.</p>
          <p>He was adopted by the Halevy family - the village leader and the only electrical-wired household (as the
            rest
            were used kerosene).</p>

          <p>We shared our impressions and experience and didn’t realise it had gotten dark and rainy.</p>
          <p>He walked along with me to the water pool where our paths parted.</p>
          <p>Before leaving the Rukhni home I looked around and thought that the iron arch at the yard’s entrance will
            help
            me find the house on my way back.</p>
          <p>It turned out that all the houses had such an arch.</p>
          <p>I contemplated my situation as it was.</p>
          <p>I was standing in an unfamiliar place in pitch darkness and light rain when</p>
          <p>I heard a voice - “Stop! Who goes there?!”.</p>
          <p>I answered I was from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Aliyah" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Youth Aliyah</a> and I was looking for my way home.</p>
          <p>Later I learned it was Alferovitz who served as a librarian in the evening and during the day fixed the
            road
            edges.</p>
          <p>He promised to take me home and asked me for the name of the family, which I’ve yet to memorise.</p>
          <p>We went to the dairy collection point that had a post with the list of all the pairs.</p>
          <p>The list was indeed there but also Dov who’s been looking for me.</p>
          <p>Everyone was happy and we went to sleep.</p>

          <p>By the next day the rain had stopped and it turned out to be a pretty day.</p>
          <p>We weren’t used to having a sunny day in the middle of winter.</p>
          <p>We gathered at the school and Eliyahu showed us the village.</p>
          <p>The village was a big ring with the farms stretching outwards and the public houses within - the mill, the
            grocery shop, the dairy collection point and a water-pool with a watchtower and a strong searchlight.</p>
          <p>From that day onwards we started our guard duties once a week in pairs operating the searchlight.</p>
          <p>The farmers had guard duties every second night for half a night at posts behind the cowsheds.</p>
          <p>The first day was spent assembling the study classes.</p>
          <p>We worked from sunrise, had lunch at 13:00 and studied every day from 14:00 in the afternoon until 18:00.
          </p>

          <p>I was used to waking up early and taking on various tasks.</p>
          <p>The two eggs omelette became a routine and most of us got zits from excess protein until we got used to it.
          </p>
          <p>When it didn’t rain we hiked in the area (all the way to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahalal"
              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nahalal</a>) and ate grapefruit along with the white skin.</p>
          <p>It was very bitter, until we were taught how to eat it properly.</p>

          <p>I got along with my young family quite well.</p>

          <p>The three year old Shulamit, affectionately called mashinka was very spoiled.</p>
          <p>She didn’t want to eat while they tried to fatten her.</p>
          <p>Her mom would run after her with a cup of cream, cacao and sugar but to no avail.</p>
          <p>One morning, as the parents were busy outside with a delivery of a breeding rooster I was left alone with
            her
            at the table.</p>
          <p>I asked her to eat her porridge and she refused. I got annoyed and gave her a good spanking.</p>
          <p>She cried but ate her food out of fear.</p>
          <p>Later she complained to her mother and I was scolded but her behaviour improved.</p>

          <p>The shower and the toilets were outside with the pipes running above the ground.</p>
          <p>This meant very hot water in the summer and during the winter, when the water was freezing we would go
            every
            Sabbath evening to visit Dov’s sister Sarah Liberman.</p>
          <p>They were in the village loner and had a bigger house with an indoor toilet and shower they generously let
            us
            use.</p>
          <p>They ran their furnace using corn cobs and also used it as a stove to bake bread.</p>

          <p>Poor, as each family earned 30 pennies to be used at the grocery that was limited on supplies - one a month
            they brought sardines, margarine and Halva.</p>
          <p>Rich, as they never ran out of cream, chicken and eggs on the table.</p>
          <p>From wheat they made (<a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/315325/breakfast-bulgur-porridge"
              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bulgur</a>) porridge. </p>
          <p>From grapes they made jams.</p>
          <p>Each farm had 180 squared kilometers (“Dunams”) and most of the land was used for “pitted” fruits so we had
            plenty of apricots, plums and apples.</p>
          <p>We also grew corn and rice and drier land was used for harvesting hay.</p>
          <p>The eucalyptus grove was public and provided us with poles for the vineyard and the perimeter fence.</p>
          <p>Every household had 3 rows of trees and was responsible to clean and maintain them.</p>
          <p>For every tree being cut new ones grew and we had to dilute them to make them stronger.</p>
          <p>Some of the wheat was sold and the rest was grounded and baked into bread.</p>
          <p>They built an oven in the yard from a halved barrel and bricks and clay, and used corn cobs as fuel.</p>
          <p>Usually the bread was quite good.</p>

          <p>My adopting family had a partnership with the neighbor so half the week we had a nice bread and for the
            rest
            of
            the week we had sticky burnt bread… </p>
          <p>The “heavy” industry was the corn as it required a lot of manual labor.</p>
          <p>We didn’t have pesticides so we had to harvest the fields twice - first at autumn when then weeds began to
            sprout and then in the spring when the soil dried to make sure it was clean from any undesirable plants.</p>

          <p>Seeding was artwork.</p>
          <p>Two oxens would carry the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump-jump_plough" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">stump-jump plough</a> that would plough the soil but not turn it.</p>
          <p>Behind the second knife a funnel was connected to hose that reached the newly ploughed furrow.</p>
          <p>You would carry a bag of corn kernels on your shoulder and while holding the reins and whip on the left
            hand,
            you would send one kernel to the funnel every 20cm.</p>
          <p>No more and no less.</p>
          <p>A good furrow is 40cm and seeding is done on every third row, so the distance between the seeded rows is
            1.20m.
          </p>
          <p>After the corn begins to sprout and grow above 10cm you would start to dilute them to be at least 40cm
            apart.
          </p>
          <p>With at least 70 sq. km per farmer with endless rows from sunrise to sunset, the job was a real
            back-breaking.

          <p>After the dilluation you should also go over the soil with a cattle-ridden <a

            to
            get rid of any weeds.</p>
          <p>After the cultivation you would go with the plough again between the rows.</p>
          <p>The corn will then grow to 1.5-2 meters high and it will blossom and ripen - fresh and green without water
            and
            with deep roots.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, you should go work at the orchids.</p>

          <p>The orchid was next to the house - mostly plums of various kinds.</p>
          <p>The soil was deep and heavy and rarely required watering.</p>
          <p>During the summer we would quarry limestone from <a

              rel="noreferrer noopener">Tel-Shamam near the railway station</a> which layers of ancient villages built
            one
            on top of the other.</p>
          <p>It was hard work with a knock and a shovel.</p>
          <p>When the soil is hard, the cattle are happy as the wagon easily moves but when the solid was soft the wagon
            would sink and would move no more.</p>
          <p>We transported soil countlessly.</p>
          <p>Similarly we transported water in barrels.</p>
          <p>The railway station had drilled underground water for the use of the locomotives and we would bring a tin
            bucket for each of the older trees.</p>

          <p>The buckets originally served for oil and petrol but along with providing a measuring unit we used those
            buckets for many things - from preserving olives or making jam to carrying water, stones, laundry, groceries
            and
            a chicken to the butcher.</p>
          <p>As secular as they were, they didn’t slaughter animals on their own.</p>
          <p>The butcher lived next to the dairy station in the middle of the town and also served as the Wedding rabbi.
          </p>

          <p>In the first summer I was asked if I can make jam from grapes.</p>
          <p>I said “of course”, as I’ve been working at Winkel’s preverves factory and I brought a recipe book with me
            for
            all sorts of fruits and vegetables.</p>
          <p>I cooked outside the house with a big cauldron on top of burning corn-cobs, continuously adjusting the heat
            and
            adding the sugar at the end.</p>
          <p>They argued the jam tasted funny as they never tried a jam that wasn’t burnt…</p>

          <p>We harvested barley (kernels for the cattle) using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaper-binder"
              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaper-binder</a> - a machine dragged by 3 mules that reaps and
            binds the sheafs.</p>
          <p>The sheafs were carried to the barn where every household had its own stack.</p>
          <p>Later in the summer we would tread the barley using a public big machine with a tractor wheel and a wide
            belt
            and fill bags of the kernel.</p>

          <p>The chaff would be shredded to provender that was used as paddings for the chicken coop and to feed the
            horses
            and the mules, especially in winter.</p>
          <p>At first they would carry the scattered straw to the barn - it was hard work and usually took a lot of
            space
            (usually above the cowshed).</p>
          <p>To improve efficiency and minimize the storage area they would press the hay and the straw to blocks
            weighing
            20-30kg (today, people simply go to the gym).</p>
          <p>The harvested hay would be raked then pitch-forked into piles.</p>
          <p>As there were only two pressing machines for 70 farmers for quite a lengthy process they would place the
            immobiles machines (a blindfolded horse harnessed to a gears pressing the hay while walking around the
            machine)
            in the middle of the field and bring the piles using a net carried by an ox and at least two men who would
            flip
            the net on a table next to the machine.</p>
          <p>An “expert” would feed the hay into the machine using a pitchfork which would sometimes get caught in the
            machine and break.</p>
          <p>The expert would use a board with slits to pass a needle with an iron wire to tie the block.</p>
          <p>There were many malfunctions such as the wire getting tangled or the board getting tied and the output was
            130
            blocks per day, in the summer’s scolding sun.</p>

            thread but
            collecting the blocks was still difficult as they fell one by one.</p>
          <p>We built a shelf that would “catch” 10 blocks and that made life a bit easier.</p>

          <p>Along with technological progress came the air-conditioned tractor that pressed 500kg blocks and a forklift
            to
            load to the wagon and place in the barn.</p>
          <p>In the worst case scenario it required 2 men to operate, while the rest moved to work in construction.</p>

          <p>The work pace increased as well as the summer heat.</p>
          <p>At 10am the air was visibly trembling but at 11am we often had a light western breeze to cool the skin.</p>
          <p>The community was based on self-employment and didn’t hire external workers, with the exception of
            households
            who also worked in the service sector or the government (i.e the Jewish Agency).</p>
          <p>We picked the fruits and prepared it for shipping.</p>
          <p>We build a warehouse for packaging and cooling (cement building with 10cm gap between two layers of walls,

            from 2pm until 6pm.</p>
          <p>The farmers demanded that we’ll help fodder harvesting for the cows,milking and bringing the milk to the
            dairy
            station.</p>
          <p>Arguments arose and some tried to change families but that didn’t help.</p>
          <p>Throughout our stay at the town we went on several overnight trips to the Galil and <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hula_Valley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hula swamp</a>
            (today valley) and that caused a grudge that we decided to travel in the busiest season.</p>
          <p>But we went anyway, and we began talking Hebrew amongst ourselves.</p>

          <p>Only married couples were accepted to settle in the village, so one must find himself a wife.</p>
          <p>There weren’t that many women around, least to say that actually one to live in a village.</p>
          <p>Usually the young men would travel to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hana_Meisel" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Hana Meisel</a>’s school in Nahalal, grab the first girl and without asking too
            many
            questions have the butcher marry them and that’s how the villagers’ marriage looked like.</p>
          <p>At night, as we used the light-projector we would often spot unmarried couples walking along.</p>
          <p>It was quite common and didn’t really bother anyone.</p>

          <p>Once a year the “General Assembly” would select the managing committee, although most of the members were
            sleeping out, tired from the day’s work.</p>
          <p>A few other members of the village didn’t have a voting right in the assembly as they weren’t farmers - the
            blacksmith, the tinsmith, a doctor, a nurse, a painter, electrician, the lorry driver and the grocery shop
            owner.</p>
          <p>During our first year a baker joined the village and most people stopped baking bread on their own.</p>
          <p>The women would bring bread from the bakery and on their way home they would nibble on the soft inside or
            the
            crust and at home we ate the remains.</p>
          <p>Some of the members, along with farming, also handled “departments” such as the garage, education, nursery,
            the
            cows’ pharmacy or a kitchen that provided food for the few unmarried workers and temporary tradesmen.</p>
          <p>The relationships amongst the villagers were cold and it was quite common for folks not to be on talking
            terms
            with their next-door neighbors.</p>

          <p>A maid would often help around the house when the woman gave birth or was sick.</p>
          <p>When my landlady Fruma prepared to have her second born she informed me that as there are only two rooms in
            the
            house, I’ll go to sleep at the Libermans (Dov’s sister).</p>

          <p>In the evening, we would sit at the school’s porch, as it had electricity and a radio and we sang and
            danced.
          </p>
          <p>When I returned home I found the maid in my bed and I understood that Fruma went to the hospital.</p>
          <p>I went to the Libermans at 10pm and the entire village was already asleep. I cautiously knocked on the door
            but
            no one woke up.</p>
          <p>I returned to the farm and lay down on the kitchen’s wooden floor.</p>
          <p>Throughout the night I could feel the rats running around me.</p>
          <p>Early in the morning I got up and left to work, figuring it’s probably for the best.</p>

          <p>I knew I’m going to have problems with the gnomes sorting the cassettes in the wrong order and some of the
            stories happened before others.</p>
          <p>It doesn’t really matter much.</p>

          <p>Some tasks required more than one man, so “mutual help” order was issued and the villagers were required to
            assist one another, albeit being in inconvenient times.</p>
          <p>In the spring when weed began to sprout, Dov was instructed to assist a fellow-farmer named Broshik.</p>

              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaper</a> but required a scythe.
          </p>
          <p>Dov told Broshik who loved speaking Yiddish “ikh vel dir shikn dem eyngl!” (“I will send you the boy”).</p>
          <p>Broshik decided that I will scythe behind him and we agreed to meet the next day.</p>
          <p>One doesn’t sharpen a scythe with a whetstone, you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5mtstdV1k4"

          <p>It’s a special task that requires expertise and a steady hand to make sure the scythe will stay sharp for a
            long time.</p>
          <p>I learned how to do it while I was at Winkel.</p>

          <p>I spent the evening preparing my blade, just as Broshik did.</p>
          <p>The next we started working as he worked in front of me.</p>
          <p>A good scyther always rises on his toes when swinging the blade, so I took the opportunity and scythed
            underneath his heels.</p>
          <p>After a short while he instructed me to scythe in front of him.</p>
          <p>I moved fast across the field and by midday I no longer saw him.</p>
          <p>As I was preparing to leave for school Broshik announced that it was the whetstone that made the difference
            and
            I should lend him mine.</p>
          <p>I wasn’t happy about it but I didn’t have a choice.</p>
          <p>In the evening, he sent his daughter to return me the strone and when asked about his whereabouts she
            answered
            “He went to bed saying that `di yeeke hot mikh derhrget! (The Yeke killed me)`”.</p>
          <p>Everyone laughed.</p>

          <p>The corn ripened and dried.</p>
          <p>To finish our first year we had to pick and tread the corn.</p>
          <p>It’s a job that can only be done with slaves as no sane person would volunteer to do what we did willingly.
          </p>
          <p>The heat in rows of the corn was unbearable without a shred of wind.</p>
          <p>The dry leaves would cut like razor, making it possible to enter only with long sleeves, making the heat
            even worse.</p>

          <p>The mules would carry the wagon next to us as we picked the corn and threw it into the wagon.</p>
          <p>It would take half a day to fill the wagon. At noon we return to the granary to unload and we still need to
            tread.</p>
          <p>We used a similar tractor-powered pressing machine with a wide belt and a lot of appetite.</p>
          <p>It ate whatever we fed it. Now we need plenty of men to serve it to exhaustion (its and ours).</p>
          <p>We needed to serve the cobs, fill the bags and pile them.</p>
          <p>We also needed to pick the nice looking corn and tread manually for next year’s kernels.</p>
          <p>We would occasionally cheer when the “lady of the palace” who brought cold water, watermelons and grapes to
            cheer the toiling slaves.</p>
          <p>We moved from one farm to the other and hurried to finish the job before winter.</p>
          <p>We would burn the husks using a “burning harrow” which was very hot as well.</p>

          <p>The state in Palestine was also “hot” with Arabs raiding a different village and murdering people.</p>
          <p>However the newspapers called for keeping restraint.</p>
          <p>The British ruled with an iron fist but the situation still got out of control.</p>

          <p>Throughout the country there were british check posts and wire fences and identification cards were
            required
            to
            pass.</p>
          <p>The british law dictates that once a building has a roof, it’s a “done job” so jews would go out at night
            to
            build roofed buildings and that’s how we built the country.</p>
          <p>The big factories, such as the refineries employed only Arabs.</p>
          <p>So <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yagur" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kibbutz
              Yagur</a>
            was founded near haifa and the folks there went to “conquer the workplace”.</p>
          <p>This effort ended up costing many lives. The Arabs went from house to house to sell cheap produce, and we
            tried
            to combat that with “Buy only Jewish produce!”.</p>
          <p>Kfar Yehosuha was very isolated and apart from fire bottles being thrown to the fields from passing trains,
            there has been only one murder incident.</p>
          <p>Hanya Shulami went after dark to lock the cowshed and was shot from an ambush.</p>
          <p>The tracks led to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem_of_Galilee" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Bet-lethem</a> that was under German control and the search ceased.</p>
          <p>The relationship with the British authorities was good - sometimes we paid with bribes of fruit boxes and
            sometimes we thanked the officer.</p>

          <p>Most of the children were still young and only few were of our age.</p>
          <p>Our teachers taught us everything about Judaism, the love of the country and the Hebrew language.</p>

          <p>Often we would fall asleep after a hard day of work, they would understand.</p>
          <p>I can’t remember any holidays, except for the celebration of the nursery children.</p>

          <p>In 1938 we still received letters from Germany but in truth we were afraid to write because of the
            censorship.
          </p>
          <p>During ‘38 we got used to the life in the village - We learned a lot and worked hard and without a pay.</p>
          <p>We didn’t even have money to take a train to Haifa so all our life revolved around the village.</p>
          <p>Watch-duties at the light-projector served as match-making and many future couples sprouted there.</p>
          <p>We finished all the work in the field, we made jam and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgur"
              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bulgur</a>.</p>
          <p>We stowed the corncob (used to make fire) and hay in the barn and we were ready for winter!</p>

          <p>I remember a particularly hot day, everything was dry and I was smearing hot tar over pipes when children
            were
            cleaning dry weed around the building across the street.</p>
          <p>The 20m-long bungalow had many rooms - the library, the post office and the school’s classroom.</p>
          <p>Originally the bungalow was built when the village was founded each couple was allocated a room but as they
            moved to their new homes the bungalow was reallocated to public use.</p>

          <p>They piled all the weed next to one of the walls and set it on fire.</p>
          <p>Within seconds the entire building caught fire.</p>
          <p>There was no way to put out the fire and electrical wires fell and it was dangerous to come near.</p>
          <p>A metal ring at the water was used as a bell.</p>
          <p>I ran there and called the alarm.</p>
          <p>Many people came and made sure nothing else would catch fire.</p>
          <p>Everything burnt down - the library with all its books, the post office with all the letters, the
            classrooms
            and the nurseries.</p>
          <p>Until the rain came the children learned in the forest.</p>

          <p>The farm had several chickens and they had their room in the barn.</p>
          <p>They especially liked to ignore the egg-laying boxes and lay their eggs everywhere and we would end up
            spending
            hours to clean the eggs.</p>
          <p>The shredded chaff that was used as padding was filled with excrements which got pressed and became plates
            that
            got stuck to the cement and was very difficult to clean.</p>
          <p>The biggest problem is that while cleaning the room, the chicken stayed in the room.</p>
          <p>One day I was sent to clean the room.</p>
          <p>I scraped all the excrements to a pile but as I went out to find a bag the chicken just scattered it all
            back.

          <p>One particular rooster was especially active. I got angry with him, I took a broom and hit him in the head.
            He
            did me a favour and died instantly.</p>
          <p>It was very difficult to explain what had happened.</p>

          <p>During the autumn there wasn’t much work in the field, I built a new and advanced chicken coop.</p>
          <p>A guide from the agency came and injected the idea that chickens must be fed with chopped clover early in
            the
            morning.</p>
          <p>I was sent with a sickle and a bag to fetch the wet clover.</p>
          <p>I carried the full bag on my back and the dampness leaked out of the bag and into my boots.</p>
          <p>Those clover fields cause many disputes as the neighbors cows would break the fence to eat the clover.</p>
          <p>No wonder they wouldn’t talk with the neighbors.</p>

          <p>‘38 was coming to its end and we still needed to plough the fields in preparation for the winter, seed the
            wheat using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_drill" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Seeding drill</a>.</p>
          <p>Essentially it meant walking all day behind a pair of beasts.</p>
          <p>With the exception of two trips of all the Youth movement members I didn’t leave the village throughout the
            entire year.</p>
          <p>I didn’t have anywhere to go anyhow, having no relatives or acquaintances.</p>

          <p>I was happy to have work.</p>
          <p>November had the first rain and so began the rubber boots story: except the road to the railway station
            that
            was paved in the summer, all other roads were unpaved and the black soil turned upon the first rain to
            knee-high
            deep mud that one could only walk through with rubber boots.</p>
          <p>The mud was sticky too and the sides of the boots were always covered by a thick layer.</p>
          <p>Washing water was scarce and the boots got muddy back quickly anyhow so everyone walked just around covered
            with mud like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubalus" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">bubalus</a> in the Hula swamp.</p>
          <p>Before entering home or the school we had to take the boots off which was an art form on its own but the
            porch
            area was covered in mud and it was difficult to reach the door wearing only socks.</p>
          <p>Despite marking the boots and clipping them together with a clothespin, it wasn’t uncommon you were left
            without any, without knowing who took them. Some mysteries would remain unsolved to this day.</p>
          <p>Working as much as we did would put a respected slave to shame, the clothes we brought from Germany soon
            worned
            out, and we didn’t have money to replenish them.</p>
          <p>The cobbler gave me custom-made work-boots.</p>

          <p>All the farm chores remain and because of the mud they just become more difficult - harvesting greens for
            the
            cows or treading the corn into kernels by hand or with a small machine.</p>
          <p>The days have become shorter and as the villagers weren’t very friendly they never visited one another, not
            even for a chit-chat.</p>
          <p>There was no electricity and reading with the oil lantern wasn’t convenient so we would also simply go to
            bed
            early.</p>
          <p>Aside from a pedlar from <a

              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kiryat Haroshet</a>, nobody visited the village.</p>
          <p>It was extremely difficult to bring supplies on days the trains were on strike, which happened often:
            Trucks
            would bring supply as far as Jaida (today <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramat_Yishai"
              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ramat Yishai</a>) where we would transfer it to mule-ridden
            wagons and bring it to
            the small creek bordering the village.</p>
          <p>The creek had streaming water and despite the rock-built ford it was impossible to pass with the wagons, so
            we
            had to unload everything, load it onto the mules’ backs and get it across.</p>
          <p>I suggested building a bridge but they laughed at me, arguing the entire structure will just sink in the
            mud.
            We continued to study, and started to think about our future in Palestine.</p>
          <p>Things got more hostile, even between us and the British (let alone the Arabs).</p>
          <p>The opinions in the village diverged between restraint (such as <a

            offensive (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgun">Irgun</a>).</p>

          <p>We still didn’t form an opinion but external influences started to convince us to join a kibbutz.</p>

              Yaakov</a> for another year of training and getting to know the kibbutz life.</p>

          <p>In 1939 we barely had any contact with our parents.</p>
          <p>In Germany they prepared for war and Palestine was hit by a wave of riots and murders.</p>
          <p>In March my brother Hillel arrived in Palestine, as part of the youth movement and was welcomed in <a

          <p>It was only a few train stations away but I didn’t have the money for the ticket.</p>
          <p>However I did manage to visit him once, and he visited me one time as well.</p>

          <p>Winter was cold, wet and muddy.</p>
          <p>We used the time to match-make couples who would marry soon and begin their joint life.</p>
          <p>We all came from the same background so these marriages lasted for many years.</p>

          <p>We tried to form our own group but eventually failed as we were 20 pounds short to buy an old shack to use
            as
            sleeping quarters and so after two years we started to disband.</p>
          <p>A few remained in Kfar Yehoshua and started to work at the farms for a pay (3 pounds a month, food and
            board
            for 18 hours a day of work).</p>
          <p>But we were used to working and there wasn’t much to do anyhow.</p>

          <p>Going on patrol duty around the village and checking on the different posts, Shoshana was convinced I was
            paying her post an extra attention and one day she took me to meet her uncle in Haifa.</p>
          <p>He announced he agreed to marriage and we decided to marry on April 20, 1940 in two month time.</p>
          <p>They promised to come to our wedding.</p>
          <p>On a saturday evening, without a venue or an orchestra, in front of the butcher’s house we performed the
            ceremony (as he was qualified as a rabbi.</p>
          <p>In a small rented room we sang, ate and drank cakes and wine friends contributed.</p>
          <p>We went to bed rather early as we had to work the next day.</p>
          <p>Guests slept at the neighbors and left on the first train to Haifa as they had to get to work as well.</p>
          <p>After milking the cows I went to work at the corn fields.</p>
          <p>I was tired and I couldn’t remember if I seeded every row to ploughed without seeding at all.</p>
          <p>I fed the beasts, tied them to the wagon and crawled underneath to nap in the shade.</p>
          <p>When I woke up the sun was already set as I slept the entire day.</p>
          <p>I returned home for the yard’s chores.</p>

          <p>Days passed.</p>
          <p>The both of us worked in different odds and ends as things became more difficult.</p>
          <p>Europe was at war and unemployment in Palestine was widespread.</p>
          <p>No more citrus fruits being harvested as there was nowhere to export them.</p>
          <p>And then the Jewish Agency decided to support the British military effort and recruit young men and women.
          </p>
          <p>Every village was required to supply a certain number of abled bodies.</p>
          <p>For obvious reasons, it wasn’t the farmers or their children who were sent, rather than us, the workers.
          </p>

          <p>In December 1940 I went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzrifin" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Tzrifin</a> to pledge my allegiance to the British king for the duration of the
            war.
          </p>
          <p>We received uniforms with lots of buttons to polish, a bed with fleas and we began our training - Not with
            guns, rather than digging trenches and marching drills.</p>
          <p>Along with us there was also an Arab unit, and they were struggling to adjust to military life - they wore
            the
            long-johns over their trousers and when they couldn’t tell between left and right, they were given a tomato
            on
            the right and a potato on the left.</p>

          <p>Anyone who knew a little bit of English was sent immediately to sergeants’ course.</p>
          <p>We had an Irish sergeant to guide us.</p>
          <p>He was tough and he hated the English more than he hated us.</p>
          <p>We got properly vaccinated.</p>
          <p>It didn’t take long before we got our first rank.</p>
          <p>A English colonel came riding his white horse to congratulate us and asked each one for his name and why he
            volunteered.</p>
          <p>Of course the only acceptable answer was to fight the German enemy, not taking into account we left Germany
            two
            years prior.</p>

          <p>We got a 48 hours leave on the weekend and upon returning we learned we’re heading out to Egypt.</p>
          <p>The entire battalion was set in the parade ground but as the train was late (as per usual).</p>
          <p>We left someone to guard the gear and went in a cheerful mood to the canteen to drink tea and eat waffles.
          </p>
          <p>The budget was limited: we got 2 pounds and 6 pence a day while in Palestine and 4 pounds and 6 pence
            abroad.
          </p>
          <p>When we got back we realised our eating-gear was stolen, despite the guard. Every now and then merchants
            and
            soldiers would try to sell us new eating-gear and told us it was common.</p>

          <p>We boarded the train that headed to Egypt.</p>
          <p>At the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suez
              canal</a> we met a sandstorm. </p>
          <p>We couldn’t pass because the Italians threw sea-mines from aeroplanes and we had to wait until they were
            cleared.</p>
          <p>We switched to boats and then back to an Egyptian train to Amaria in the desert, near Alexandria.</p>
          <p>At the first train station we met Egyptians for the first time and they tried to sell us all sorts of stuff
            such as chocolate, wallets and pornography.</p>
          <p>We didn’t know the language and we got cheated.</p>

          <p>An Arab approached me with small heavy packages and claimed it was chocolate.</p>
          <p>I bought a pack for all my friends for 30 pennies but it turned out to be dates worth only 5 pennies.</p>
          <p>I told the battalion sergeant who was from Jerusalem and spoke Arabic and he informed the Scottish captain
            who
            pulled out his gun.</p>
          <p>We caught the Egyptian who returned the 30 pennies, plus one more penny as a fine.</p>

          <p>Amaria military camp stretched as far as the eye could, with soldiers from all across the British empire
            and
            a
            lot of Australian Jews.</p>
          <p>On the first night we slept with gas masks as we couldn’t breath because of the sand in the air.</p>
          <p>We setup tents and waited for the Australians to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Compass"
              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conquer Tubruk</a> from the Italians.</p>
          <p>Water was scarce so we didn’t shower much.</p>
          <p>We had one Jewish lieutenant, sent by the Jewish Agency, while the rest were British.</p>
          <p>One morning He decided to call on “Operation Shower”.</p>
          <p>Equipped with a towel and soap, we bagan marching towards the shower shack a sand storm started and we
            could
            barely find our way.</p>
          <p>Nobody wanted to be first but the lieutenant gave order to the sergeants to set an example.</p>

      <article class="page">
        <section class="page_content">
          <p>The sand stuck on the wet body and the operation was cancelled.</p>
          <p>By this time the storm had gotten worse and we couldn’t see more than 1m ahead. We began going back.</p>
          <p>I was at the rearguard when Saadia the Yemenite (Jew) passed out.</p>
          <p>He was a small fellow so I could easily carry him on my back but as soon as I did, I lost sight of the rest
            of
            the men and we were lost in the desert.</p>
          <p>After a while we reached a train track. I went along the track until I found a small cabin of an Egyptian
            tailor who shortened soldiers’ trousers.</p>
          <p>He gave me some tea.</p>
          <p>I used two eucalyptus to build a stretcher and I carried the sleeping yemenite back to the base.</p>
          <p>I came across a military ambulance who carried Saadia away, not before showing me the direction of the
            camp.
          </p>
          <p>I met Saadia 4 years later and he told me it was all a show to get kicked out of the army but it didn’t
            work.
          </p>
          <p>There were other cases like this: For example, a guy named Kiri from Jerusalem who woke up one day
            complaining
            he lost his hearing but he wasn’ discharged. One day he appeared with a small stone that fell out of his ear
            and
            after that he got his hearing back, but that wasn’t the end of his story.</p>

          <p>One evening we, all the NCO (Non-commissioned officers), traveled to the soldiers’ club of the Jewish
            Community
            in Alexandria.</p>
          <p>They gave us a good dinner and every one received a sheepskin sweater.</p>
          <p>We didn’t feel anything from the war yet.</p>
          <p>Eventually we returned to the base and boarded the 23,000 ton British warship Motor Primer heading to
            Tobruk
            in
            Libya.</p>
          <p>Upon arrival we realised the docks are no longer there and we had to go ashore on boats.</p>
          <p>My platoon was assigned for offloading so we stayed overnight on the boat and as the bunks were cleared we
            allowed ourselves to go sleep in them. Early in the morning there was a heavy bombardment as the Italians
            threw
            seamines from high altitude to sink ships.</p>
          <p>However, we slept very well.</p>

          <p>On the shore there were two 3-stories high concrete buildings that were previously occupied by the Italian
            fleet.</p>
          <p>We took hold of the ground floor as our barracks.</p>
          <p>The Australians captured the (not so big) city a few days earlier and proceeded towards <a

              rel="noreferrer noopener">Tripoli</a>.</p>
          <p>Ships brought gear, ammunition, food and supplies that we offloaded and sent with trucks to the front.</p>
          <p>There were bombardments every day and every night.</p>

      <article class="page">
        <section class="page_content">
          <p>One bomb fell on our building and passed through every floor but luckily no one got injured.</p>
          <p>We worked hard and in the evening we played bingo to candle lights.</p>

          <p>One day when we went to work at the harbor two aeroplanes appeared and the Jewish lieutenant announced -
            these
            are ours!</p>
          <p>They started shooting but were brought down by a strong anti-air fire from near the harbor.</p>
          <p>We arrived at the harbor and the sea was stormy.</p>
          <p>A small boat brought us to the ship we were meant to offload.</p>
          <p>As we started climbing the rope ladder the tall ship swayed from the waves.</p>
          <p>One moment we were hanging between see and air and the other we were bashed on the ship’s side.</p>
          <p>A small boat brought a raft and tied it next to the ship.</p>
          <p>Cranes carried big nets and we would fill them with the cargo - benzin barrels, shells and ammunition and
            then
            put stacked them on the raft which would later be dragged ashore.</p>
          <p>We worked for two hours when a fuel boat next to us was hit by a seamine.</p>
          <p>Its anchor detached, a 2x2m hole gaped at it’s side and it began leaking oil.</p>

      <article class="page">
        <section class="page_content">
          <p>The waves brought it closer and closer to us until it hit us and the sea began to burn in an area of
            10sq.km.
            with a lot of fire and smoke.</p>
          <p>These old boats had big stones at their bottom that kept the balance (as opposed to modern-day ships which
            pump
            the fuel from one side to the other to maintain balance).</p>
          <p>As the fuel tank hit us it shifted the stones in our ship and the entire ship leaned 45deg to its side.</p>
          <p>One side of lifeboats were hanging in the other they laid on the side of the ship and were useless.</p>
          <p>The only way to leave the boat was to slide on the cable to the raft.</p>
          <p>Luckily my task before the explosion was to handle the crane’s steel cable and because it was greased I got
            a
            pair of leather biker’s gloves.</p>
          <p>I slid then and thanks to the gloves my hands kept unhurt.</p>
          <p>An Arab Sergeant major came on a small motor-boat through the fire and the smoke and dragged us with the
            explosive-filled raft back to shore.</p>
          <p>It was chaotic.</p>
          <p>All soldiers, including generals, carried ammunition boxes and other explosives out of the danger zone in
            case
            the ship would explode.</p>
          <p>An Extinguishing ship that happened to be near placed a ring of foam around the ship as soldiers and
            sailors
            jumped to the sea in hope to swim to the shore, but it was too far and they choked from the smoke.</p>

          <p>The next day it was my misfortune to bury them in the desert.</p>
          <p>We took a <a href="https://www.scalemates.com/kits/tamiya-mm192-lrdg-command-car--122861" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">command-car</a> and the entire platoon brought digging equipment to dig the
            graves.
          </p>
          <p>The desert was solid as concrete and we ended up using hand grenades to make 7 half-meter graves.</p>
          <p>When a sandstorm began I instructed the many to hide in the graves as I covered them with raincoats.</p>
          <p>When we saw carlights pulling over we got out of the graves, but the soldiers thought we were being raised
            from
            the dead and they ran off.</p>

          <p>Here also ends the story of “deaf” Kiri as he saved the life of an Australian soldier during the fire.</p>
          <p>He received a medal and a stipend from the Australian government and we never saw him again.</p>

          <p>We worked hard but willingly, supplying provisions to the front and learning a lot about offloading boats.
          </p>
          <p>We worked in a field-bakery in the middle of the desert and baked bread for many soldiers.</p>
          <p>One day a cooling-ship arrived and brought us meat.</p>
          <p>As we didn’t have any way to preserve it, we started gobbling meat three times a day, to the point that the
            soldiers at the food queue would suffice with just soup.</p>

      <article class="page">
        <section class="page_content">
          <p>The food supply would normally go to the supply base in the desert, not far from the sea, with streets of
            preserves of all sorts - a street for tea, another for meat, fruits, condensed milk, vegetables and
            biscuits.
          </p>
          <p>The different units would send a truck with an order of what they need.</p>
          <p>However the boxes weren’t marked with stickers, rather a letter or a number pressed on its lid.</p>
          <p>Sometimes a box would break and all the tin were piled to a huge heap. I was sent to sort out the boxes by
            their order.</p>
          <p>We opened a few and wrote down what each letter or number meant. Very quickly we learn to recognize the
            shape
            of the boxes as well - tall, short and wide.</p>
          <p>We worked all day long and ate a lot of tasty things from Australian pears that melt on the tongue, dipped
            in
            dutch cream to a huge range of meats.</p>
          <p>By nightfall each of us prepared a bag with cans to bring to our friends - pineapples or sweet cream.</p>
          <p>Aboarding the command-car a British sergeant appeared and instructed us to empty our bag as we weren’t
            allowed
            to take anything.</p>
          <p>I tried to convince him to let us take at least one can per soldier and he agreed under the condition I’ll
            find
            a box numbered 66.</p>
          <p>I found one and took a can for myself as well as I was curious about the hidden treasure.</p>

          <p>Upon arriving at camp I opened it and realised it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnip"
              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turnip</a>. I threw it to trash.</p>

          <p>Days went by.</p>
          <p>We packed all the gears and got ready to move to a new front.</p>
          <p>We moved all our personal belongings and the battalion equipment to the harbor and were ready to load it to
            our
            ship- the “Alastair Prince”.</p>
          <p>We sat by the peer and waited as many Italian prisoners-of-war boarded another ship, along with Australian
            soldiers who were taking the cabins as they headed for a well-deserved vacation.</p>
          <p>On the way out of the port the ship hit a sea-mine and sank. All the boats came to help immediately.</p>
          <p>Most of the Australians drowned but a few of the Italians who were on the deck survived.</p>
          <p>We gave them the battalion’s blanket as they were very wet.</p>
          <p>By nightfall, a boat took us to our ship that was anchored in the middle of the port.</p>
          <p>One of the soldiers fell between the ship and the boat and by the skin of his teeth we managed to pull him
            out
            a moment before he was crushed to death.</p>

          <p>We began our journey to an unknown destiny before sunrise.</p>
          <p>We came across a few sea mines along the way, we tried to shoot them but without success.</p>

          <p>This time we stay on the deck as a precaution.</p>
          <p>After 3 days we arrived at Piraeus, Greece.</p>
          <p>Along with us came a ship from India with mules that were scattered everywhere.</p>
          <p>We helped get them back and marched with our military gear through Athens towards the train to <a

          <p>Our job was to build Hangers for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarine_Spitfire"
              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spitfighters</a> using sand bags to protect them from bombings
            It was a hard job
            and
            it took us many hours but we did so happily.</p>
          <p>After a while the planes were sent to another front and we became obsolete.</p>

          <p>We boarded a cargo train to leave and this is the first time I’ve encountered the fifth column - people who
            were planted by the Germans years earlier to sabotage the war effort when time comes.</p>
          <p>First, they got rid of the train drivers. Luckily a few of our men could handle it.</p>
          <p>Then we learned some of the carts were disconnected.</p>
          <p>We hooked them up and started on our way towards Athens.</p>
          <p>A few kilometers off the city we stopped at a place called <a

            amongst vineyards and olive groves.</p>

          <p>Some of the men changed their shoes but they didn’t know how much agony it will bring them later.</p>
          <p>And now the German bombings began. At this point they parachuted over the Thermopylae mountains and were

            firing

          <p>We hid between the olive trees.</p>
          <p>The Germans’ aim was good and they bombed only small sections at a time.</p>
          <p>British soldiers came and ordered us to flee.</p>
          <p>We moved on but Germans planes changed course and many Brits suffered from many casualties.</p>
          <p>We were informed that our boat The Alastair Prince is waiting for us at <a

            will take us back home.</p>
          <p>But alas, when we arrived at Argos we saw the city was aflame, works of the fifth column.</p>

          <p>We hid until nightfall when trucks arrived to take us to continue our retreat.</p>
          <p>Each platoon got a number and it was all set.</p>
          <p>The first to disappear was our sergeant.</p>

          <p>We walked along the convoy and asked the drivers for their number.</p>
          <p>Eventually we got to our track - number 68 but the lieutenant on board told us he can’t take us.</p>
          <p>By the starlight I could see the lieutenant’s gun pointing at me.</p>
          <p>I couldn’t argue with him so I dispersed the men to the other trucks until I was the only one left.</p>
          <p>The convoy began to move.</p>
          <p>I stopped a GMC that I could Hebrew coming out of and asked for a hand to pull me up.</p>
          <p>“There’s no space” they replied.</p>
          <p>I loaded my gun and ordered them to let me in.</p>
          <p>And indeed, the truck was completely packed.</p>
          <p>I climbed to the roof and and held at one of the rims to my dear life as not to be tossed over at the
            curves.
          </p>
          <p>And indeed, The curves were very sharp and one of the cars flew straight into the ravine.</p>
          <p>I lay on the truck’s canopy for 11 hours and by the end of it I needed help getting down as my arms went
            completely numb.</p>
          <p>We reached <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalamata" target="_blank"

          <p>When the battle was won we walked towards the shore, walking in rows of 6 men as we saw boats carrying
            soldiers
            to a fleet of ships.</p>
          <p>When we arrived at the shore we realised the fifth column had sabotaged the remaining boats and by midnight
            the
            ships set sail, taking with them our last chance for escape.</p>
          <p>Soldiers who did manage to get to Crete were later captured when the German took the island just the same.

          <p>At 2am they informed all the commanders that as we ran out of ammunition and medical kits, we shall
            surrender
            to the Germans by 5 in morning.</p>
          <p>Whoever wishes to flee may do so, and those who choose to stay should shave and clean themselves as they
            are

          <p>By first light a truck arrived and two Yoguslavian (at least according to the outfit) jumped out of it and
            fled. We checked its cargo and found millions of Yoguslavian banknotes and money.</p>
          <p>We made a campfire and roasted meat. Some put money in their battle-dress pockets.</p>
          <p>We used an empty ammunition box and buried some of the money under a tree next to a well, planning to
            return

          <p>Years later, when I did manage to find my back there, the tree was already gone and instead a big highway

          <p>The German soldiers treated us respectfully. We were transferred as groups to a cargo train and were taken

          <p>We crossed the canal by a bride made of boats.</p>
          <p>We came across a former Italian PoW camp who were just released as they allied with the German.</p>
          <p>The area was crawling with lice and it didn’t take long for it to get on us as well.</p>

          <p>After some time in horrible conditions we arrived at an army camp at Thessaloniki.</p>
          <p>This was the first time we were registered as official prisoners of war. Our equipment was inspected and
            anything of value (soap, watches, money) was stolen, at least the items we didn’t hide.</p>
          <p>I remember cooking an especially delicious soup in my helmet before we were placed on a train again on our
            way
            to Yugoslavia. We traveled for days, 50 people in a cart meant for cattle.</p>

              rel="noreferrer noopener">Stalag VIII-B Lamsdorf</a> at the east of Germany.</p>

          <p>We quickly learned how to smuggle goods, such as radio parts so we could listen to the BBC and learn what
            is
            happening in the world.</p>
          <p>Every evening, one of the prisoners tells us the news he heard over the radio.</p>
          <p>A second gate was placed beyond the HQ that led to a street with compounds on both sides, each compound
            with
            3
            buildings that hold 300 prisoners.</p>
          <p>The showers were in the middle of the compound along with the boiler.</p>
          <p>The compounds were fenced with a 2m high barb wire and a tower with a light-projector and an armed guard
            that
            oversaw the entire area.</p>
          <p>A 50cm high trip-wire was set before the high fence and anyone crossing it would be shot for an attempted
            escape.</p>
          <p>During the 4 years I was there, there were no incidents near the fence.</p>
          <p>On the contrary- the buffer area was used to grow vegetables (and discard excess dirt we had from digging
            tunnels).</p>
          <p>The side of the compounds that faced the main street was 0.5km long.</p>
          <p>Its gates were from the morning count until sunset so we could visit other compounds.</p>
          <p>4x4m water-holes were situated in the main-street along the inner fences, fenced with wooden-poles and a
            wire.

          <p>Their purpose was to put out fires but occasionally one could find a dead body floating - a german spy that
            was
            caught.</p>
          <p>At night the German would patrol the street with their guard dogs.</p>
          <p>One time the guard sent his dog to inspect noises coming from one of the cabins.</p>
          <p>The cabin happened to be occupied by the Australians who lifted it in, ate in and only its skin remained
            hanging on the fence.</p>
          <p>Internally, the camp was managed by the British, as prisoners of other nationalities were transferred to
            other
            camps.</p>

          <p>The German soldiers- the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Wehrmacht</a>, As oppose to the Nazi party’s SS, didn’t meddle with out
            day-to-day
            life and left it to the British NCO.</p>
          <p>According to the Geneva Convention, the NCO weren’t obliged to forced labour, but could volunteer as
            translators or help manage the work.</p>
          <p>We had an “escape planning” committee who organized escape routes, papers and clothes.</p>
          <p>Often pilots would have a german-speaking soldier (usually an Israeli) assigned to them to escape together.
          </p>
          <p>Many tried, few succeeded.</p>
          <p>There were many attempts to dig tunnels under the fences for massive escape, but they were usually
            discovered
            before completion and filled with sewer.</p>

          <p>Perhaps the Germans knew about them but did nothing as it kept the prisoners occupied.</p>
          <p>The punishment for escape, which was the duty of every soldier, was a few days in isolation.</p>

          <p>Twice a day we had to stand in rows of six for counting, as a German officer would count the rows out loud.
          </p>
          <p>One of the prisoners would do an excellent impersonation of dog barking and would constantly throw him off
            the
            number.</p>
          <p>We had a designated escapee that we hid and he kept appearing for the count occasionally until the day he
            actually escaped (using the Red Cross visiting van) but by this point, the German’s countings were so
            unreliable
            they didn’t notice it.</p>

          <p>The British soldiers sure loved their tea, and they made great efforts to get it.</p>
          <p>They used the 100 litres tank from the showers and either burned old shoes heating or would use electricity
            to
            electrify and boil the water.</p>
          <p>Of course that caused the fuse to switch, so they had a soldier standing by the fusebox in charge to switch
            it
            back on as soon as possible and before the German would notice.</p>

          <p>On good days the Swiss Red Cross delivered packages with boxes of food.</p>
          <p>However the boxes were poked as not to be used for an escape.</p>

      <article class="page">
        <section class="page_content">
          <p>The packages were tied with a string that we used for multiple purposes and we also learned how to use the
            boxes to make buckets, a chimney for the heater or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellows"
              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bellows</a> that we used to boil water with twigs quickly.</p>
          <p>Trading was quite developed as cigarettes (that also came from the packages) were used for payments.</p>
          <p>For example, all the Israel (Jews and Arabs) soldiers received a gift for Passover from the <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_MacMichael" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">British
              High-Commissionerof Palestine</a>’s wife - package with sandals (hand-made by Arab children) and <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matzo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">matzos</a>.</p>
          <p>We didn’t have much use for sandals but we sold them for cigarettes, and the matzos didn’t survive the long
            journey (via Egypt) and became crumbs.</p>
          <p>I use the cigarettes to buy tweezers and a small screwdriver that I could use to fix watches.</p>
          <p>Most of the time the problem was dust so merely taking the watch to pieces, cleaning it with a little oil
            and
            putting it back together got a reputation earned me with cigarettes to buy chocolate and tea.</p>

          <p>A short while after we arrived, a group of 500 Jewish prisoners (out of the 1500 who were captured in
            Kalamata)
            were sent to a labour camp at Ehrenforst (today <a

              Canal</a>”.</p>
          <p>The Canal connected the river Oder to Gliwice and served an important role transferring coal to Berlin.</p>

          <p>A flood has broken a dam and destroyed the canal and we were sent to fix it.</p>
          <p>We were managed by a contractor company named <a href="https://www.kieswerk-mueller.de/unternehmen/chronik"
              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Müller</a> Bruch- und Kiesbau (Müller’s bricks and gravel) that
            had
            the proper equipment - small locomotives, turning v-shaped carts and a few Baggers (excavators), along with
            managers who didn’t favor the regime, were kind to us and eventually fled to Switzerland.</p>
          <p>The camp was fenced and the cabins stood on piles and iron-cast furnaces inside as the area was freezing.
          </p>
          <p>One cabin belonged to a German major named Hauptmann and his soldiers (the guard).</p>
          <p>A Jewish sergeant named Chaim Globinsky was our liaison and he negotiated with the German in Yiddish to
            everyone’s satisfaction.</p>

          <p>Every room had 25 people in bunk beds. The shower and the outhouse were in a separate cabin.</p>
          <p>The Germans normally didn’t go inside the camp.</p>
          <p>We worked every day from 7am until 4pm. Upon our return, we received a warm meal, cooked by a German
            (outside
            the camp) with the aid of Polish maids.</p>
          <p>However he would steal the meat to bribe the girls, or to buy watches from the prisoners, which eventually
            led
            to his demise.</p>
          <p>Since our food was poor, we opened one of the watches and curved a prisoner’s number inside.</p>

          <p>When the watch appeared on one of the girls’ arm we reported to the German officer and the next day
            Military
            Police arrived, opened the watch and the thief was sent to the Russian front.</p>
          <p>A few days after we got a new cook, a delegation of officers arrived to inspect the quality of the food.
          </p>
          <p>I stood next to the window (from which they served the food) and witnessed the story unfold.</p>
          <p>An office checked the cauldron with a serving spoon that came out filled with meat and potatoes.</p>
          <p>He announced - “Even our soldiers at the front don’t get such great food!” but Globinsky answered “This
            isn’t
            the cauldron but a pot hanging inside of it that produces the good food”.</p>
          <p>They checked and another soldier was sent to the Russian front.</p>

          <p>After this incident we were served excellent food.</p>
          <p>The work progressed well and we were on good terms with the formen who were <a

              rel="noreferrer noopener">volksdeutsche</a>
            (Germans who lived near the border and usually spoke Polish).</p>
          <p>We also traded with them tea, chocolate and soap from our Red-cross packages in exchange for bread (as we
            only
            got one slice per day).</p>

            he
            dried and sealed with a tape and sold it as new to a German farmer who was quite happy with it (apparently
            it
            still had enough taste in it) but wondered out loud why there’s a picture of a cow on the box.</p>
          <p>I later bought a razor blade from the German that I kept to this day.</p>

          <p>Every day we smuggled to camp inside our coat a 4km lump of coal so we didn’t lack fuel for heating.Winter
            came
            and we had a nice stack of coal to keep ourselves warm.</p>
          <p>Coming back from work, one would turn on the heater and the other would add coal as time went by.</p>
          <p>One time We added too much and the heater and the chimney became red hot.</p>
          <p>We feared the wooden-built building would burn.</p>
          <p>We laid naked on the bed until a wise-guy opened a window.</p>
          <p>The heater got more oxygen and burned even fiercer.</p>
          <p>The camp’s wire fence was one meter away from the window and one of the security guards saw us.</p>
          <p>He sent Globinsky to ask- “if you’re naked because you’re roasting then why did you open the window?”
            During
            the night the heater cooled down and we managed to get some sleep.</p>

          <p>A locomotive with 10 v-shaped carts of 2sq.m brought the material that froze on the way and got stuck to
            the
            sides of the carts.</p>
          <p>It was very difficult to release it and there was the danger the entire cart would flip over.</p>
          <p>Using long wooden beams we held the wheels of the cart and usually we managed.</p>
          <p>Between the train unloadings we had time to warm ourselves next to a barrel with burning coal that we took
            from
            the locomotives and charcoal on top.</p>
          <p>The temperature was between -15c to -20c and without wind it felt cold but wasn’t horrible.</p>
          <p>When the wind would grow stronger the work would end and we returned to camp as it felt like -30c.</p>

          <p>One day the last cart flipped over and all but the locomotive and the first cart flipped with it.</p>
          <p>The formen yelled “Sabotage! Quickly! Lift the carts back”. Easy to say but impossible to do.</p>
          <p>They brought the chief foremen and a group of Polish workers but they couldn’t do anything and they left.
          </p>
          <p>As an NCO, I was a translator and not a worker, as the rest were forbidden from talking in German.</p>

          <p>I had an idea.</p>
          <p>I bargained with the chief foremen and asked him - “If we’ll do the impossible and put the carts back on
            track
            - will we be allowed to go back to camp early?”.</p>
          <p>It was very cold. He immediately agreed.</p>
          <p>We placed new tracks downhill from where the carts lay and unhooked the locomotives.</p>
          <p>Rolling the carts downwards towards the new tracks was much easier and soon enough we returned to our camp
            for
            some warmth.</p>

          <p>Due to the cold the project was put to a halt and we were sent to work in the construction of a factory
            that
            was an hour walk away on an ice-frozen road.</p>
          <p>The factory turned coal into 22 different products - benzol (oil), margarine, clothes and more in a process
            called <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrierwerk" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Hydrierwerke</a>.</p>
          <p>40,000 people worked, prisoners of all nations - British, French, Yugoslavian, Russian and more.</p>
          <p>Amongst them were also Jews from the concentration camps.</p>
          <p>We arrived on the first day with our escorting German soldiers, most of them were soldiers from the Russian
            front who were sent to rest with a relatively easy assignment of guarding us.</p>
          <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camp_commandant" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">commandant</a> asked who we are and the soldiers answered - British-Jewish
            prisoners.</p>

          <p>He sent us to work with the German Jews who were guarded by the Nazi-party members SS soldiers.</p>

          <p>The entire building was built using bricks and our job was to load the bags of bricks up to the fourth
            floor.
          </p>
          <p>The German Jews were all young men in their twenties physically depleted and had plenty of bickering
            amongst
            themselves over small things.</p>
          <p>We, on the other hand, had packages from the Redcross and plenty of food.</p>
          <p>We sat them aside and gave them our sandwiches we made for lunch.</p>
          <p>They were starving.</p>
          <p>Their SS guards saw this and sprung on them with whips, forcing them to get up.</p>
          <p>But when our guardian soldiers, all veterans from the front, saw what had happened they grabbed the whips
            from
            the SS soldiers’ hands and threw them to the river.</p>
          <p>A big commotion ensued and eventually we were transferred elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Our new task was to unload bricks from train carts. We received working gloves as it was very cold (-30c)
            and
            the sharp bricks would peel the skin of our hands.</p>

          <p>Our supervisor, a German elder, wrote down the list of workers I handed him, so he would charge 50 <a

            head
            to
            Müller company for our work.</p>
          <p>He had an iron-cross pin on the lapel of his coat and I knew he was a party member.</p>
          <p>His office was nice and warm and I told him that “it’s nice and warm as back home” but he retorted that
            England
            is rather cold right now as well.</p>
          <p>I told him we came from Palestine and he didn’t want to believe me - “You don’t look like Jews and you work
            much better than anyone else”.</p>
          <p>I convinced him and we got along well. We agreed that we’ll work contractually - 2 carts per day and we get
            to
            return to camp at 2pm (not too early so not to draw suspicion).</p>
          <p>Our guard-soldier was also pleased with the arrangement.</p>
          <p>Alas, after the factory was completed and we were transferred to our next assignment, the American bombed
            it
            to
            rubles.</p>

          <p>We were transferred to the paper mill in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krapkowice" target="_blank"

          <p>Two paper mills stood next to one another, both belonged to <a

          <p>They would make wet cellulose for newspaper productions, usually from tree pulp and office paper of better
            quality (from rags).</p>

          <p>After a day’s journey in a cattle-train we, 50 prisoners, arrived at 2pm to <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blechhammer" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Blechhammer</a>,
            4km away from the mills at what was previously a dance-hall of a restaurant.</p>
          <p>Early morning the next day we headed to the factory.</p>
          <p>The stench in the air was awful from strong chemicals that were used to disseminate the wood and it was
            hard
            to
            breath.</p>
          <p>Again I got the honorary role of translator and shift-manager.</p>
          <p>The labour was physically intensive as all the materials were heavy - wood, coal, cellulose, sodium and
            more.
          </p>
          <p>The industrial dust and the soot would fill the lungs and everything was manual (with the exception of the
            motorised shredder).</p>
          <p>The foreman - a short hot tempered German was trigger happy and the russian prisoners, who wouldn’t
            understand
            a word in German would get shot on a daily basis.</p>
          <p>We had a South-African doctor who spoke English who checked the sick patients but it was the German
            sergeant
            who decided who is sent to work.</p>
          <p>The sleeping quarters were very crowded and the sanitary conditions were dismal, as we got back from work
            very
            dirty.</p>
          <p>But at least there we didn’t have any interaction with the Germans.</p>

          <p>My job was to wake up at 5 and get everyone ready for inspection outside the inn.</p>

          <p>We would then march for 10 minutes to where we would hitch the train to take us to the factory.</p>
          <p>Sometime when we got punished for whatever reason, we had to walk our way back.</p>
          <p>My situation was quite tricky - with my speckless British military outfit I stood out and everyone came to
            complain - the prisoners about the hard labour and the Germans that we don’t work fast enough.</p>
          <p>From all the prisoners in the factory - Polish, Russian and English, it was us, the British-Jews who got
            the
            best terms, as we had a good negotiator - me.</p>
          <p>I saw German fluently and I always knew to appease everyone.</p>
          <p>One time I saw a German soldier hitting one of my friends with the heel of his gun and he was about to kill
            him
            when I called a German security guard I was on good terms with and we broke up the fight.</p>
          <p>To this day I don’t know what started it.</p>
          <p>There was a trial, the soldier was sent to the front and my friend was sent to prison for a short period.
            One
            day I felt pain in my kidneys and the South-African doctor sent me to the hospital in the main camp.</p>
          <p>We arrived late at a very cold night and everyone was already asleep.</p>
          <p>My escort already left and the guard at the gate sent me to a vacant building with broken windows.</p>
          <p>With no blankets, I used straw mattresses to cover myself and I was cold through the night.</p>

          <p>In the morning an English doctor examined me and didn’t find anything, but a German doctor who stood by
            asked
            me to describe my pain. As I did, he immediately hospitalised me.</p>
          <p>Indeed, the hospital was run by English physicians and medics but as there were 42,000 soldiers in Stalag
            VIII-B one couldn’t stay sick too long - you either get better or you die.</p>
          <p>It feels that this hospital works in reverse - if you complain about your status, you’ll be dismissed on
            the
            very day but if you claim that everything is fine, you’ll be required to stay for a few more days.</p>
          <p>Some of the boys there were imputed to the hip, sitting in baskets. One of these boys received shoes from
            home
            and he polished them every day until they shined like a mirror.</p>
          <p>I don’t know if he ever realised he’ll never get to wear them.</p>
          <p>I realised very quickly I shouldn’t stay there and after a few days I returned to camp.</p>
          <p>All the Israelis who didn’t go work were packed in a single building with horrible conditions, but I was
            lucky
            that my rank allowed me to stay at the English/Canadian building.</p>
          <p>I spent the time fixing watches and sewing collars, slippers and shortening trousers.</p>
          <p>These odd jobs paid with cigarettes that were used as currency for buying food. The situation wasn’t at all
            bad.</p>

          <p>Every day we would hear in big speakers the latest news about German advancement in Russia and the common
            belief that by next Christmas this will all be over and we would go back home.</p>
          <p>We were sure of it.</p>

          <p>One day, new prisoners arrived - French Canadians who tried to invade <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieppe_Raid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dieppe</a>
            (Normandy, France).</p>
          <p>It was a cliff area and the Germans were sure it would be impenetrable.</p>
          <p>At night time the British brought the Canadian commandos by boat, shot roped anchors and used them to climb
            the
            rocks, ever so quietly.</p>
          <p>Advancement was steady.</p>
          <p>German soldiers they encountered were tied and sent back to the boat.</p>
          <p>Eventually the Germans took notice and captured the commando.</p>
          <p>They also spotted the British boat and sank it but were horrified to find the tied German corpses being
            washed
            ashore.</p>
          <p>As reprisal, the German used the Red-Cross parcel strings (they didn’t have any of their own) to tie our
            hands.
          </p>
          <p>They then patrolled amongst us to make sure we didn't decuff ourselves.</p>
          <p>In the evening they would untie us and tie us again the next day.</p>

          <p>It wasn’t comfortable as it was very cold and we couldn’t put hands in our pockets.</p>
          <p>After a few day they broughts handcuffs from the prison with a 30cm chain between them, but not for
            everyone.
          </p>
          <p>In the evening when they came to collect the strings and chains they were surprised that everyone was back
            in
            strings again (and the chains at the bottom of the toilet’s pit.</p>
          <p>A few days later we were all with proper chains. We learned to pick the locks very quickly but it almost
            cost
            me both my hands.</p>
          <p>I went to rest in the afternoon and put the chain on the pillow next to me.</p>
          <p>A German soldier noticed it and as punishment tied my hands behind my back to stand outside in -20c for two
            hours.</p>
          <p>When I was allowed to come back inside my hands were bloodless blue and frozen.</p>
          <p>After a long massage the blood flowed again and they were saved.</p>
          <p>After a month they collected the chains and things went back to normal.</p>

          <p>One of my friends attended the hospital and told me he was stationed in <a
              href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%BCddeutschland" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Süddeutschland</a> near the border to Slovakia, at a sand-to-glass factory.</p>
          <p>I decided to join him.</p>

      </article>
      <article class="page">
        <section class="page_content">
          <p>The sand was mined from a mountained and after being crushed it was poured to holes with water from a
            stream
            that ran through the factory.</p>
          <p>The water ran through and the sand sank.</p>
          <p>It was a good place even if the work was hard- loading wet sand bags, each weighing 23kg, to a train, 20ton
            per
            cart.</p>
          <p>Work was done in contracting and as we learned to work quickly, we had plenty of free time to walk freely
            to
            the forest to collect mushrooms.</p>
          <p>Our dorms even had indoor showers and toilets.</p>
          <p>Occasionally, I worked to harvest at the nearby farmers in exchange for a proper meal with meat.</p>

          <p>This lasted a few months.</p>
          <p>The factory was privately owned and we were treated well.</p>
          <p>The German sergeant would go with trips with us in the nearby area.</p>
          <p>Our meals were made by a Czech woman aided by her fifteen year old daughter but when rumors spread of her
            fraternizing with one of the prisoners, it all broke down and we were sent back to camp.</p>

          <p>The year was 1944 and the allied forces were advancing in all fronts and again Christmas crept closer with
            its
            annual promise for us to go home.</p>

          <p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hanukkah</a>
            I
            met a New Zealander priest who tried to convince me to immigrate to New Zealand after the war but I was too
            much
            of a Zionist and declined (in hindsight I admit it was a mistake), claiming that I will be persecuted for
            being
            a Jew anywhere I would go except for Israel.</p>

          <p>Our barracks had many windows and each window had a table for 10 prisoners, 5 on each side.</p>
          <p>At noon each table got a shoe-box-sized carton that the kitchen would fill with boiled unpeeled potato for
            each
            table and a loaf of bread (so each person would get 1 slice) with coal-based <a

            (one
            block for 20 people).</p>
          <p>Sometimes we got soup from potato peels and pickles, with an occasional piece of meat.</p>

          <p>Next to each window we built a small oven with a chimney made from tin cans that we used to boil tea.</p>
          <p>Every day a group went to the forest to collect wood for our ovens, but when the Russian front drew near it
            became forbidden and we no longer had wood to make tea.</p>
          <p>Everyone knows that the British army fights over tea.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, the main street had water holes fenced by a wire on wooden poles.</p>

          <p>But we got caught by the regimental sergeant major who didn’t want to get in trouble with the Germans and
            so
            we
            were sentenced to 28 days in confinement.</p>

          <p>Food was scarce there so we were first sent to be fattened a bit.</p>
          <p>The dungeon was a concrete structure with small cells and a bunk.</p>
          <p>As the cells were in high demand, we had to share it with a cellmate.</p>
          <p>It was straining.</p>
          <p>It was cold and with no blankets or heating and a small barred window near the ceiling.</p>
          <p>We were supervised by a scarred tough German who made our life bitter.</p>
          <p>We could hear the speaker outside announcing German victories on all fronts, which we knew were a lie.</p>
          <p>We spent 12 days telling each other our life’s story as we heard on the 12th day that the camp is being
            evicted
            and compound 1 and 2 are to be abandoned already.</p>
          <p>At that moment, Scarface opened the cell doors, holding a gun in hand and threw in our shoes (that were
            usually
            outside to deter our escape) and half a bucket of boiled potatoes and fled.</p>

          <p>We received a red-cross Christmas parcel with frozen food. We were so hungry we just ate it frozen.</p>
          <p>The temperature outside was -20c. We left early in the morning, a group of 1000 prisoners.</p>
          <p>Upon leaving the camp, each of us got a frozen loaf of bread as provision for the road.</p>
          <p>The road was all icy and everything was beautifully covered with snow as far as the eye can see.</p>
          <p>We kept our gloved hand in our pockets as once we took them out it was too cold to do anything anyhow.</p>
          <p>At 10am we had a break and we tried to eat but it was ice-frozen.</p>
          <p>We continued onward but I caught an unstoppable diarrhea and barely made it before sunset to the barn in
            which
            we spent the night.</p>
          <p>After consulting with a medicine-less English doctor, I remained to lie down, along with 50 other men,
            while
            everyone else left.</p>
          <p>The Germans hurried as the Russian front was 40km away, wishing us a quick death. We laid there until 10am

          <p>A friend caught a chicken, killed it, buried the feathers under a pile of manure and cooked a soup in a
            metal
            helmet.</p>
          <p>That helped me back to my feet.</p>

          <p>After a few days we returned back to the Stalag as the Russians had passed and continued their march
            towards
            Berlin.</p>
          <p>The Camp was mostly deserted with only a handful of Germans, no electricity, now water and everything
            covered
            in deep mud.</p>
          <p>We dug a well and began burning furniture (beds, tables and benches).</p>
          <p>We had plenty of food provided by the Red Cross. It was like a convalescent home.</p>
          <p>I remember cheese as big as a cartwheel and hard as stone we sawed using a mandolin string.</p>
          <p>The sergeant-major still in charge and he orchestrated everything.</p>
          <p>Other prisoners started returning along with those who fled the exodus march.</p>
          <p>In February we boarded a train to Czechoslovakia until our locomotive was commandeered and we stayed on the
            tracks for three days.</p>
          <p>Some of my friends fled from there and reached a concentration death and it was their British uniforms that
            saved them from a certain death.</p>

          <p>After a week of starvation on suffering we arrived at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Kissingen"
              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bad Kissingen</a> and from there we marched to <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammelburg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hammelburg</a> -
            a
            castle on a mountain that had barracks with American prisoners.</p>

          <p>Our stay was short, we got food and by the end we burned the barracks’ wooden floor for heat.</p>
          <p>One morning a siren informed us we’re leaving again as <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_S._Patton" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">general
              Patton</a>’s troops were spotted at foot of the mountain.
          </p>
          <p>We marched, a thousand prisoners per group and escorted by a few old German soldiers (as all the young
            soldiers
            were in the fronts).</p>
          <p>We were promised that our food supply will follow us but we never got to see it.</p>
          <p>By twightlights it started raining and I got tired of it so I told two of my Israeli friends that they can
            continue if they wish but I’m staying here.</p>
          <p>And they replied that if I’m staying then they will stay with me.</p>
          <p>We left the group and hid in the forest.</p>
          <p>We spent the entire day in the forest hoping the Americans would arrive and it started raining.</p>
          <p>We spent the night under our raincoat but it was a miserable feeling.</p>
          <p>In the morning my friends decided to return to the road and head towards the village we left and the
            American
            army.</p>
          <p>We came across a German farmer and greeted him good morning.</p>

          <p>He passed but then returned, wondering if we’re the invading forces, and asked who we were and we answered
            we’re Australian soldiers.</p>
          <p>He escorted us to his village and they celebrated in our honour.</p>
          <p>Every family brought food and drinks, and I was the translator, speaking in broken German even though we
            all
            knew German very well.</p>
          <p>Throughout the day neighbors came by wanting to know when the war would be over.</p>
          <p>By nightfall they brought us to an abandoned projector-light post outside the town by a hill.</p>
          <p>It had a couple of beds and blankets and we went to sleep, hoping our troubles were over.</p>
          <p>At midnight the teenage boys in charge of operating the projector returned and kicked us out.</p>
          <p>We were led to a farmer who was awoken from his sleep. His wife woke up and the party continued with
            sausage
            and cider until sunrise.</p>
          <p>We chatted and said we were farmers in Australia and promised to help out in the farm until the forces
            arrived.
          </p>
          <p>However in the morning we learned there were a group of about 100 French prisoners in the villagers’ home.
          </p>
          <p>We tried to discreetly flee but were too sick to run and were caught rather quickly. They gathered
            everyone,
            including us, to the town’s square.</p>

          <p>This was Easter 1945 (April 1st) and as we sat in the square we saw all the residents properly dressed for
            church.</p>
          <p>The weather was nice and the sun was warm.</p>
          <p>We were now under the control of a Nazi party member who called the headquarters and was ordered to deliver
            us
            to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marburg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marburg</a>.
          </p>
          <p>We argued we were sick and couldn't walk.</p>
          <p>The village elders decided to prepare wagons and drives to the next village and off their hands while
            leading
            us towards the town.</p>
          <p>The two German soldiers and their sergeant walked along the wagons or sat with us.</p>

          <p>At the town they settled us in a school’s basement that served as a bomb shelter, along with the villagers
            who
            held no grudge towards us.</p>
          <p>The ground shook at each dropped bomb and dirt fell on our heads from the wooden roof cracks.</p>
          <p>We stayed there for several days.</p>
          <p>Every day one of one took a small waggon to bring food from a distribution centre.</p>
          <p>When it was my turn I saw the trucks arriving with bread and sausages.</p>
          <p>Risking a bullet in the head, I hid a couple of sausages in my battle-dress.</p>

          <p>After a week we joined the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_march" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">death march</a>”, along with the rest of Germany, as everyone preferred to meet
            the
            allied forces and not the soviets.</p>
          <p>Every morning a soldier came by, driving a motorcycle and gave the sergeant instructions for our next
            destination.</p>
          <p>A truck delivered us bread and we got beet and potato soup from the villagers at the villages we reached
            every
            evening.</p>
          <p>We walked 25km each day and were in good spirits, singing “<a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3WPted_ihs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we’re hanging
              our
              washing on the Sigfried lines</a>”, to the discontent of our caputeres who couldn’t do much about it.</p>
          <p>We were 3 Jews, along with South Africans, Americans and a few Englishmen.</p>
          <p>Every evening we would reach a village and they were usually located by a stream we could wash ourselves.
          </p>
          <p>We traded eggs, milk and bread in exchange for a woolen scarf Shoshana sent me through the Red Cross (and
            every
            time before leaving, I managed to secure it back).</p>
          <p>We had plenty of everything.</p>
          <p>We marched throughout April, sun or rain, a village at a time.</p>
          <p>Our numbers growing up to a 1000 men and commanded by a German lieutenant major who announced one day we’re
            going to stay there, at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilgertshausen-Tandern" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Hilgertshausen</a>.</p>

          <p>We went into a barn to rest on the hay.</p>

          <p>I had a cold after walking all day in the rain and my coat was wet and heavy.</p>
          <p>I didn’t feel well.</p>
          <p>An Australian asked me “Simon, when is this bloody war going to end?” and I told him “Tomorrow morning at
            eight
            oclock” and indeed the next day, at eight in the evening, they arrived with very loud tanks.</p>
          <p>From the beginning of the week we saw SS men fleeing, leaving their gears behind and the residents locking
            themselves indoors as the prisoners began dismantling the village.</p>
          <p>The australian killed chickens using their boomerangs and when the tanks arrived we were in a good mood.
          </p>

          <p>The next day the German soldiers surrendered their weapons and became our prisoners.</p>
          <p>We led them to the train on their way to a prisoners camp and then stayed standing on the road, not sure
            what
            to do next.</p>
          <p>An American major walked by and engaged in a conversation.</p>
          <p>We told him we were from Palestine and he replied “Mazal tov! I’m also a Jew!”.</p>
          <p>He invited us to dinner of a roast duck and then directed us to a priest in charge of cases like us.</p>
          <p>Again we got food and then sent to a transport unit with big black drivers heading to <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augsburg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Augsburg</a>

              rel="noreferrer noopener">Ingolstadt</a> and we couldn’t cross the (Danube) river so we stopped to rest at
            one
            of the villages.</p>
          <p>This was the first time I ever saw sleeping bags.</p>
          <p>All the drivers went to sleep and the villagers sat outside their home, dreading their future. I couldn’t
            fall
            asleep.</p>
          <p>I heard noises coming out of a basement so I went to inspect and found a herd of 30 cows aching to be
            milked
            (all the villagers sat in the church hoping Jesus would protect them there).</p>
          <p>I sat down and began milking them.</p>
          <p>By morning I had a couple of buckets and the drivers were very pleased.</p>
          <p>Outside the building an English soldier cooked eggs over a primus (camp stove).</p>
          <p>He had a suitcase filled with eggs, each individually wrapped in a newspaper, and he asked everyone “how
            many?”.</p>
          <p>We ate eggs. I asked for some bread at a local bakery and they ordered me to spread my arms as they piled
            10
            loaves for me.</p>
          <p>We crossed the Danube on another road and arrived at Augsburg by midday. We said farewell to the drivers
            and
            found the local MP.</p>
          <p>They directed us to a military camp occupied by an American division.</p>

          <p>We got battle rations and blankets by the metre rolled around a broom.</p>
          <p>We were treated very well as we headed to the airport.</p>
          <p>A English-Jewish lieutenant was in charge of the runaway and although there were many aeroplanes coming and
            going, he didn’t permit us to leave due to bad weather conditions above the English channel.</p>
          <p>After two days aeroplanes arrived bringing Oil in gericans and we flew to Brussel.</p>
          <p>That was May 8th - the end of the war and there were celebrations everywhere.</p>
          <p>The sergeant-major has already arranged everything on our behalf at the base so our registration was quick,
            we
            received some money to spend the night and the next day we flew with bombers to Oxford.</p>

          <p>We were welcomed at a big hangar where we powdered with DDT against lice.</p>
          <p>Women organisations and the Red Cross took care of us.</p>
          <p>They meant well but we were tired and wanted to rest.</p>
          <p>Outside the hangars were small booths - a booth for each country - Australia, Sudan, New Zealand and
            Palestine
            where soldiers would register the former prisoners and direct them to trucks that will take them to
            different
            camps across England.</p>
          <p>I went to the Palestine booth and was sent to truck #58.</p>

          <p>As we departed by nightfall, an aeroplane took off and its wheels nearly touched the tarpaulin top of the
            trucks.</p>
          <p>The Englishmen joked that after surviving five years captivity we return home and get killed.</p>
          <p>We drove into the night.</p>
          <p>We weren't happy with the driver so we replaced him.</p>
          <p>We stopped on the way for some fish-and-chips.</p>
          <p>After a couple of hours we realised we got lost and didn’t have a clue where we were.</p>
          <p>By midnight we arrived at a military base filled with Indians.</p>
          <p>The officer on duty welcomed us with tea and explained about the area to us.</p>

          <p>We arrived at a multinational registration camp by early morning.</p>
          <p>Everyone was still asleep but the chief cook was Jewish so he gave us special treatment.</p>
          <p>The British army believed captivity can make one “a little funny in the head”, so we had special teams with
            lots of patience to treat us.</p>
          <p>We got new gears, clothes and shoes, fitted to us by a special officer (A Jew who was a tailor in his
            civilian
            life) and we looked like soldiers again.</p>

          <p>A lieutenant colonel gave us our salaries. He brought the money to each person’s seat as he feared we would
            be
            too tired to stand in front of him.</p>
          <p>We spent the entire day eating and watching movies.</p>
          <p>We had plenty of drinks, chocolate and shaving machines and brushes (I had 7).</p>
          <p>It felt like paradise.</p>

          <p>After two days I received a list of all the Israelis along with train tickets, to lead them to <a

              rel="noreferrer noopener">Newcastle-under-Lyme</a>.</p>
          <p>We got a lift to the train station and we traveled all day, having lively conversations with British
            citizens
            and showed us great respect.</p>
          <p>When we arrived we learned that no one was waiting for us.</p>
          <p>The people from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Brigade" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Jewish Brigade</a> who were sent to treat us (as the trained English didn’t know
            our
            language) went to have fun with some girls and didn’t have time for us.</p>
          <p>I pulled over a military truck and it took us to camp, where we met all our friends and we took things into
            our
            own hands.</p>
          <p>I got the role of the “mail-minister” with a personal commandcar and a driver.</p>
          <p>I drove to town to send and fetch mail and kept myself busy.</p>
          <p>We had medical examinations and as we were former PoW we received special treatment.</p>

          <p>Although everything in England was rationed we got plenty of everything - vouchers for clothes, public
            transport and food.</p>
          <p>As we sat to eat an officer came and asked us if everything was alright and as it was custom that the
            highest-ranking soldier in a group would answer I replied “It’s not that great”.</p>
          <p>“How is that?” and I answered “Not enough food!” and explained: “you need to slowly adjust for normal
            portions
            otherwise you’ll get sick”.</p>
          <p>He was very kind to us.</p>

          <p>There was one problem: the girls!</p>
          <p>There was a big shortage with young men as the Americans already left, the war in Japan continued and the
            English boys were in the far east, So be became the girls’ target.</p>
          <p>I bought myself a wedding ring and that helped a little.</p>
          <p>Later I gave the ring to Hava, Hillel’s wife at their wedding.</p>

          <p>Any one who had friends and relatives in the UK got a vacation to visit them and those who were alone were
            invited by the Jewish communities to spend time with guest families.</p>
          <p>We registered and traveled to Manchester.</p>

            received us at the train station as he could speak in Hebrew and he took us to the JSC (Jewish Soldier

          <p>After the meal we went to the office one by one or in pairs to receive the addresses of our hosts.</p>
          <p>The shamash assigned my friend Israel and me to Yulius Tobkin, whose wife worked at the club’s cafe.</p>
          <p>The time was 3pm when we approached her and talked with her in English.</p>
          <p>She said she’s working until five when her husband comes to pick her up.</p>
          <p>She told us to walk about the city for a bit (Manchester is always raining) and be sure to be back by five.
          </p>
          <p>We were hoping to be hosted by a rich family and have a great time.</p>
          <p>She was working in the club and he worked until 5pm, probably a factory owner.</p>
          <p>That’s fate. And so, we walked in the rain in the big city and came back at 5pm.</p>
          <p>A mini-minor arrived and we sat in the back. We drove out of the city.</p>
          <p>I commented to Israel in Hebrew that we’re driving far and the wife turned out and said with a fluent
            Hebrew
            that we’ll arrive soon.</p>

            in the list of the recruits returning from London and asked if indeed I was Shoshana’s husband as she was

          </p>
          <p>In the evening we went to a tea-house <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Lyons_and_Co."

          <p>It was closing time but as Alice knew the waiter we managed to get tea and cake while the waiter cleared
            the
            table.</p>
          <p>Normally each customer would get one sugar cube and often it would be left unused.</p>
          <p>As the waiter left his cart with a bowl of all the unused sugar cubes next to me I reached out and shoved a
            handful into my pockets.</p>
          <p>Alice was very embarrassed.</p>
          <p>Years later, when she visited us in Israel, I mentioned this but she couldn’t remember.</p>

          <p>After gaining some pounds in England we began our journey back home.</p>
          <p>We boarded a boat and unlike the previous time we ate on the deck, this time we got a place in the queue to
            the
            dining room.</p>
          <p>We arrived at Alexandria and then took a train to a military-supply base at <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kassassin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kassassin</a>.
          </p>
          <p>All our uniforms were retrofitted to fit the climate.</p>
          <p>The base had a swimming pool and sometime my friends would go for a quick swim, including my Yemenite
            friends.
          </p>
          <p>But as this was a “white-only” pool they quickly replaced the water and forbade the "natives" from
            swimming.
          </p>

          <p>The next day we traveled all day until we reached a raising-bridge over the Suez Canal that got hit by a
            passing boat.</p>

          <p>We waited all night for it to be repaired and continued our journey the next day.</p>
          <p>The next stop was Rehovot where we were greeted with singing and grapes.</p>
          <p>Eventually we arrived at the base from which we originally left - <a

          <p>Even though I was married, I didn’t have a wife: She joined the British army as well and now was</p>
          <p>stationed in Italy, I was informed upon arrival at the <a

          <p>Here I was a soldier on vacation and nowhere to go.</p>
          <p>My brother Hillel was in the Brigade abroad and the only address I had left was Shoshana’s elder sister
            Edith
            Shokner in Ahuza neighborhood, Haifa.</p>
          <p>I took the bus, hoping to find a bed for the night.</p>
          <p>I barely found the address but they welcomed me in even though they barely knew me.</p>
          <p>Her husband Helmut worked as a driver (supplying groceries to the British) as well as little off the books
            to
            make a living.</p>
          <p>He used to walk all the way from the city to Ahuza to save the bus fair.</p>
          <p>I spent the night there and the next day I traveled to Kfar Yehoshua.</p>

          <p>At the evening assembly they asked to know how did I, as a Jew, managed to survive the Nazi regime.</p>

          <p>After a few days Shoshana returned from Italy, making her long journey via Egypt.</p>
          <p>She also received her paid leave. We met at the Haifa’s military base gates, we kissed and continued our
            lives
            as if we’ve never been apart.</p>
          <p>We want to settle down in Palestine and work the land (the result of being brainwashed for many years).</p>
          <p>As soldiers we found it easy to travel hitch-hiking with the British army.</p>
          <p>When we arrived at British Naval base at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jalama,_Haifa"
              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jalama</a> we got on a commandcar driven by an Indian driver

          <p>I flew out of the car and hit my head on a gun rack, someone laid under the car screaming and I saw my wife
            sitting next to a shocked Englishman on the road, trying to push a toothbrush to mouth to open his
            dislocated
            jaw.</p>
          <p>A jeep drove by with two MP, I asked for their help but they replied they’re off-duty and drove off.</p>

          <p>An Arab bus on his way to Nazareth stopped on his way and helped us get the Englishman from under the car
            and
            collect the rest of the man.</p>

          <p>In the meantime another jeep arrived, we loaded everyone and drove to the Airbase hospital, where they
            received
            the wounded and wanted to take care of us as well but we just wanted to leave as soon as possible and we
            said
            we’re ok.</p>

          <p>We got a ride to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zir'in" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Zir’in</a> (today Kibbutz Izrael) where most of our friends from the Youth
            movement
          </p>
          <p>settled but we were so banged up from the accidents we just wanted to sleep.</p>
          <p>The next day they all went to work and we couldn’t find them,so we continued our trip to <a

          <p>We saw an “Hotel” sign on building from black rocks and walls of 1m thick.</p>
          <p>The day was scorching hot but inside it felt like a refrigerator.</p>
          <p>The landlady gave us a room and we had an afternoon rest.</p>
          <p>When we got up we bathed in the water collected in the winter and toured the city.</p>
          <p>The city was very different than today.</p>
          <p>There were many bath-houses, cemeteries and restaurants, mostly of fish and everything was very cheap.</p>

          <p>We spent a few lovely days, swimming in the Sea of Galilee and touring the area.</p>
          <p>From there we continued to Jerusalem, to visit Shoshana’s aunt.</p>
          <p>Her uncle worked as a senior executive in the Jewish Agency Archive and they had three children.</p>
          <p>We had dinner with them and went to sleep in a hotel.</p>
          <p>It was all very nice, it’s wonderful to have a good time but ultimately we had to think about the future.
          </p>
          <p>We wanted to settle in one of the villages but it wasn’t easy.</p>
          <p>We could also join the Kibbutzim as they were looking for cheap labor but we wanted to be independent.</p>
          <p>But first we need a room to call home.</p>

          <p>We traveled to Kfar Yehoshua as we didn’t know anywhere else, and got a place to stay - in a barn 4x4m in
            size
            divided with a curtain for us and another worker.</p>
          <p>On the first night I caught 17 rats who were surprised by our invasion.</p>
          <p>The crate in which Shoshana packed our belongings before joining the army herself and stowed at a friend’s
            house was ravaged by the rats and there was little to salvage.</p>
          <p>As our vacation ended we returned to the army, hoping to be discharged.</p>

          <p>Shoshana succeeded and immediately started working in the village as a laundress and a seamstress.</p>
          <p>I was assigned, along with the rest of the former PoW, as a military police. It was a convenient job and it
            was
            interesting.</p>

          <p>One day a brigade soldier showed and announced he was a deserter (missing from the army for 21 days) as he
            just
            returned from Europe where he’s been searching for his parents who disappeared during the holocaust.</p>
          <p>Failing to find them he decided to return and report.</p>
          <p>I put him in a holding cell we had in the office and I reported to my Scottish captain who sent the British
            sergeant major to convince the lad to be tried by him as he’ll give him a puny punishment such as cleaning
            toilets or working in the kitchen.</p>
          <p>He refused and so he was sent to a military court where he was sentenced to 28 days in the military prison
            in
            Gaza.</p>
          <p>At first I took him to Serefand to be medically examined to confirm he’s fit for “agony” and unfortunately
            for
            him, he passed.</p>
          <p>He stayed in our holding cell until the day came and I brought to him Gaza.</p>
          <p>A big wall surrounded the city in the desert, with a wicket gate and a bell.</p>
          <p>I rang the bell and a black face appeared in a hatch “What do you want?”.</p>

          <p>I informed him I brought a prisoner.</p>
          <p>He opened the gate and said “bring him in”.</p>
          <p>As the poor guy walked in the black guard kicked him in the buttocks and we entered the reception room.</p>
          <p>An Englishman instructed him to take off his clothes as they looked for concealed weapons.</p>
          <p>As I handed his documents I noticed the prisoners were eating their lunch while running around the parade
            ground and I left.</p>
          <p>On the way to our base in Rehovot we came across a truck convoy of East African black soldiers.</p>
          <p>One of the trucks hit us and caused damage to our car.</p>
          <p>We couldn’t understand their language and very quickly we were surrounded by these menacing soldiers.</p>
          <p>We quickly wrote down the details and fled. Later I reported the accident and that was the end of it.</p>
          <p>After 28 days We returned to retrieve the chap and we asked him what it was like.</p>
          <p>He answered that it would be better if he'd simply forget this horrible short time in his life.</p>

          <p>Meanwhile, the situation in the country became explosives as both the <a

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Irgun</a> acted
            against
            the british and the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Military_Police">Red caps</a>” were
            brought
            to
            re-establish order.

          <p>All the former-PoW were sent to build a tent-camp near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beersheba"
              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beersheba</a> in the desert but we refused and went on a hunger
            strike.</p>
          <p>As the food was the “King’s pride” high-ranking generals were summoned to investigate the matter and
            eventually
            the tent-camp idea was discarded.</p>
          <p>And then a thing happened: The same PoW who notoriously fraternized with the fifteen year old maid and was
            also
            part of the Irgun, was in charge of the arsenal for the night.</p>
          <p>His assignment was to sleep inside with the door locked from within and only open it to an agreed password.
          </p>
          <p>At 11pm the sergeant major visited all posts including the arsenal but signed “midnight” in the logs,
            heading
            out to Tel Aviv to visit his wife</p>
          <p>At 11:30 a group of Irgun members pushed a truck quietly near the arsenal’s window and the sergeant passed
            them
            the weapons and then returned to sleep with the door locked.</p>
          <p>The chaos started in the morning when it was discovered that all the weapons were stolen.</p>
          <p>The British MP investigated and arrested the sergeant, the sergeant-major and many other people who signed
            the
            logs.</p>
          <p>I was incredibly lucky as I was on vacation that weekend.</p>
          <p>At that time, stealing from the British wasn’t frowned upon by the Jewish community.</p>

          <p>After a few days the same folk tried to pull a similar trick in another base but the Indian soldiers took
            notice and chased them down with knives between their teeth.</p>
          <p>The British understood we were of no use to them and they discharged us.</p>
          <p>We were recalled back to Serefand where we got civilian clothes, a suit with a tie, shoes, skirts, the
            final
            paycheck and a ride home.</p>
          <p>Thus concluded my 5 years of military service.</p>

          <p>I returned home and tried to work but couldn’t. I was fit and healthy but the mental change took me some
            time.

          <p>We spent the time checking for places to settle in, but we couldn’t find anything we liked, until we

          <p>“The Valley” (HaGay) cooperative farm was initially founded by Dutch zionist capitalists with workers who
            worked on the farm and stole anything that was glued shut.</p>
          <p>In the meantime the farm bankrupted and a few buildings remained.</p>
          <p>It was a beautiful place, albeit underdeveloped: to the foot of the mountain (Carmel) and viewing the
            valley
            (Izrael) that we knew.</p>
          <p>50 sq.mr plot of land - 5 for the farm, additional 5 in the mountain and the rest in the valley.</p>

          <p>The House was very modest - 34 sq.m.</p>

          <p>Twice a week I took guard duties as we were harassed by Arabs all the time.</p>
          <p>We took a 150 pounds load and I built a chicken coop and a chick-run.</p>
          <p>By the end of 1946 we moved to our own home but until 1948 we didn’t have electricity.</p>
          <p>For cooking and light we used petroleum and we heated water outside using wood.</p>
          <p>We lived in the small room and the other room was used to raise chicks.</p>
          <p>When incubation finished and we took out the hens and the excrements the stench lingers far after.</p>

          <p>The drylands plots weren’t divided yet so we worked on them together.</p>

            with
            seeds and pulling the seed dispensers and we would leave for the fields.</p>

          <p>Our morale was high. We didn’t hear much of the news as there was no electricity and therefore no radio as
            well.</p>
          <p>We only learned through the newspaper which settlement was raided (by Arabs) during the night.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the women stayed at home to look after the chicks and did the shopping until we got home at
            nightfall.</p>
          <p>We bought a goat for the milk.</p>
          <p>In the evenings we would sit by the kerosene lamp, read a bit and went to sleep.</p>
          <p>In the first building I constructed from wood and tin plates we housed the chickens and the hens in one

          <p>We were constantly harassed by viper snakes as we invaded their territory.</p>
          <p>We’ve been told about several children from the village who died as they couldn’t reach the <a

              rel="noreferrer noopener">hospital
              in Afula</a> in time.</p>
          <p>We didn’t have a phone, nor a car.</p>
          <p>Once a day the bus went out, and then returned in the afternoon but we didn’t travel much as we were busy
            with
            work.</p>
          <p>The work was plentiful but the income was little, and so we lived a modest life.</p>
          <p>The Arabs were herding their sheep a few dozen feet from our home so we decided to build a fence and get a
            dog
            to provide a sense of security.</p>
          <p>I traveled to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krayot" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Krayot</a> and purchased a pure beautiful and friendly black female dog we named
            “Alma” (Damsel).</p>
          <p>One day a herd of sheep invaded our plot. She woke up, charged and chased the sheep away.</p>
          <p>She and her offsprings served us for many years.</p>

          <p>The rains started.</p>
          <p>Back then rain was “real rain”. It rains for days and nights making it impossible to leave the house.</p>

          <p>We would fold a bag over our head to run our chores.</p>
          <p>There were no roads and the entire village became a big mud swamp.</p>
          <p>It was difficult to cross the flowing creek towards the town hall and we and two more households were cut
            off.
          </p>
          <p>I built a sled and we slid in the mud.</p>

          <p>We received a little budget and I started building a stable, this time with full blocks there were made
            without
            cement - a work of art.</p>
          <p>Around that time, 3m long aluminium plates were imported from Australia.</p>
          <p>They were very light and didn’t require heavy construction to hold them so I used them as the roof of the
            shed.
          </p>
          <p>One of our neighbors built an outhouse and didn’t want to cut the plates so he ended up with a 3m high
            structure.</p>
          <p>When construction was finished we moved the horse and the goats there.</p>
          <p>Now the chickens could occupy the two rooms and we finished the chick-run.</p>
          <p>We also increased the size of our goat-herd and also got a male-goat that got to serve all the goats in the
            village, which provided additional income.</p>

        <section class="page_content">
          <p>Our children grew on goats’ milk and cheese and it seems they’ve gotten something from the male-goat as
            they
            all grew up to be just as stubborn.</p>

          <p>In February 1947 Roni was born.</p>
          <p>We looked for someone to perform the circumcision and ended up with the doctor who served us at his home.
          </p>
          <p>We welcomed our guests to our home on the hill, serving them tea with 14 thin glasses we bought for the
            occasion.</p>
          <p>Over time Roni ended up breaking all of them.</p>

          <p>In march, we were getting ready for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Purim</a> ball in the town-hall and we wanted to dress up as dark-skinned folks.
          </p>
          <p>Everyone was young and wore costumes.</p>
          <p>We left Roni in his crib and Alma to look after him.</p>
          <p>Occasionally I would step outside the hall (that was 500m away and not much else around) to listen in case
            he
            was crying.</p>
          <p>At midnight we returned home and we could hear his screams as we approached.</p>
          <p>He managed to take off his nappies and stained the entire bed, however we couldn’t touch him as we were
            covered
            in soot.</p>
          <p>The water I heated outside wasn't warm yet and when his mother breastfed him, he suckled a bit off the soot
            which affected him to this day.</p>

          <p>Spring came and we decided to cultivate our rock-filled plot on the hill.</p>
          <p>One Friday morning I took a ride with HaZorea’s milk-car (that also took ours) to the <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kfar_HaNoar_HaDati" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Youth
              farm
              at Kfar Hasidim</a> to bring cauliflower seedlings.</p>
          <p>I only got the bag of seedlings in the afternoon and I carried the heavy bag on my back onto the main road.
          </p>
          <p>Traffic was always sparse and on this day it completely dried out. In those days anyone would pick a
            hitchhiker
            but this time there was no car at all.</p>
          <p>By nightfall an HaZoera truck appeared filled to the brim with crates and told me there’s absolutely no
            room
            for me and my bag.</p>
          <p>Nothing helped - we loaded the bag on top of the driver’s cabin and me on top of that.</p>
          <p>We later spent the entire night planting the cauliflower to the moonlight, she grew beautifully and we
            succeeded in the mission.</p>

          <p>Times were hard and every day the Haganah fought the British, the Arabs fought us and the Irgun blew up the
            building, amongst them the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David_Hotel_bombing" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">King David Hotel</a>.</p>
          <p>We managed to accomplish a lot.</p>
          <p>Roni grew and already stood in his crib.</p>
          <p>On a night where a battle took place in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mishmar_HaEmek"

          <p>I was on guard duty up the hill and every time I passed by the house I checked the situation.</p>
          <p>Shoshana informed me it’s time for her to head to the hospital in Afula. I comforted her asking her to hold
            on
            until morning as there was no way to get there but it didn’t help.</p>
          <p>I remembered a pickup truck that was “recruited” (confiscated) in HaZorea.</p>
          <p>I rode the horse, gunshots all around me to ask for permission to borrow the truck and take her to the
            hospital.</p>
          <p>Permission was granted under the condition two armed guards will accompany her.</p>
          <p>I volunteered to be one, leaving Roni sleeping alone at home (I wonder if he remembers it), and the other
            should have been Haim the blacksmith but his wife Rachel refused to allow him to go.</p>
          <p>Time was pressing so I went alone along with the driver.</p>
          <p>We couldn’t drive through Mishmar HaEmek due to the fights so we took a detour through <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiryat_Tiv%27on" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kiryat
              Amal</a>.</p>
          <p>When we arrived at the hospital, I left her at the entrance to the maternity ward and quickly rushed back
            home
            to Roni.</p>
          <p>We agreed that after the birth she will deliver a message via the bus driver to the Kremer at the bakery.
          </p>
          <p>A taxi driver from Haifa who used to buy eggs from us promised to bring her and the baby home when times
            come.

          <p>However we didn’t get either a message nor did the taxi show up. But Shoshana did manage to find her home.
          </p>
          <p>She gave birth the same night I dropped her at the hospital, and after 3 days she was discharged as they
            had
            many wounded men to attend.</p>
          <p>She heard a rumor of two casualties near Kiryat Haroshet and feared it was me and the driver (later we
            learned
            these were two engineers from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekorot" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Mekorot</a>).</p>
          <p>But because of the incident no one wanted to drive her to that area.</p>
          <p>Eventually a taxi driver pitied her and agreed to bring her to Yagur where the bullet-proof bus from Haifa
            would stop for her.</p>
          <p>She didn’t have money for the taxi-fare and luckily the driver agreed to let it go just so he could get
            away
            from there.</p>
          <p>The bus arrived with our neighbor Fritz and gave her money for the ride and that’s how she arrived home.
          </p>
          <p>Because of the gunshots we evacuated her and the baby to a neighbor’s basement.</p>
          <p>On top of that, another neighbor was supposed to come wash the diapers but couldn’t make it so I heated the
            water outside when the gunshots quieted down and Shoshana washed them.</p>
          <p>That night I had guard duty again.</p>

          <p>It was very difficult to build a farm without money, loans and budgets were very scarce. We were fortunate
            to
            be able to do many things ourselves.</p>

          <p>The British made life even more difficult - one day they’re in our favour and the other they’re against us.
          </p>
          <p>Armed cars of the Arab Legions patrolled the main roads.</p>
          <p>Somebody put a roadblock not far from HaZorea and as I watched from the guard tower, two British sappers
            came
            to demolish it.</p>
          <p>They laid down the charges and pulled the string but nothing happened.</p>
          <p>One of them came closer to check and then it exploded.</p>
          <p>Another time, one of our neighbors bought heavy glasses for his chicken battery cages but again a roadblock
            near the bakery.</p>
          <p>This time the British waited for the bus and commanded the passengers to get off and dismantle it.</p>
          <p>Along the way they broke his glass.</p>

          <p>We worked during the day and guarded during the night, not stopping for a moment.</p>
          <p>Many new immigrants arrived and we built a transit camp from tin-plates alongside the road.</p>
          <p>As the farm itself didn’t require too much work (and didn’t provide much income either), I worked in
            construction and that helped us sustain ourselves and buy materials to keep building the farm.</p>

          <p>A truce was reached with the aid of the UN and the British left.</p>

          <p>With the approval of the UN, the British divided the desert-land into two parts and we got the smaller
            part,
            filled with swamps.</p>
          <p>We still didn’t have electricity so one day a friend told us he heard over the radio that we now have a
            state
            of our own.</p>
          <p>But now all the surrounding countries wage a war against us- Palstenians, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, Iran,
            Lebanon
            and Syria.</p>
          <p>There were approx. 600,000 Jews living in Israel and more Jews came from all around the world to help us
            fight.
          </p>
          <p>The war was bloody, several villages were abandoned and then reconquered.</p>
          <p>All the men were enlisted to the army, sometimes up to 30 days, putting a heavy burden on the wives who
            left
            alone to take care of the farms and the children.</p>
          <p>After many casualties the Arabs asked the UN help to reach a cease-fire and the <a

              rel="noreferrer noopener">war of independence</a> ended.</p>

          <p>Yokneam has grown and we developed a cultural life with celebrations in the townhall and festivities in the
            fields.</p>
          <p>Every Saturday morning we would take the children for a walk in the mountains or we traveled through the
            field
            to Kfar Yehoshua to visit Shoshana’s adopting parents who acted as the children’s grandchildren.</p>

          <p>We would celebrate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_Seder" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Passover dinner</a> with them in either our place or theirs: We would load the
            cart
            with blankets and ride through the fields and late at night when we rode back the children would sleep, all
            snuggled in the back.</p>
          <p>We kept in touch with the family in Haifa and visited them occasionally.</p>
          <p>Over time more farms were added on the hill and we weren’t so isolated anymore.</p>
          <p>In 1948 we finally got electricity installed.</p>
          <p>When I refused to have the power line to my neighbors through my plot as I feared it would make cultivation
            more difficult the engineer told me I should move to the Negev and get electricity in the next decade, I
            eventually yielded.</p>
          <p>Electricity made life much easier.</p>

          <p>We fought the Arabs but also the soil.</p>
          <p>When we got our plot in Yokneam, there were many fundamental things we didn’t know and no one told us.</p>
          <p>The land between the mountains and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kishon_River" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">Kishon river</a> was a big deep swamp without any drainage and was uncultivated
            most
            of the year.</p>
          <p>We improved it over the years by putting a lot of effort and money digging drainage trenches but still the
            cultivation period was only between May and October.</p>
          <p>And so we decided to turn to livestock farming.</p>

          <p>We became slaves to the animals for the next 40 years.</p>

            chickens came cycle after a cycle.</p>
          <p>But we were happy.</p>
          <p>We felt we’re building the country and fulfilling the pioneers’ dream, as Jews in Europe <a

          <p>We would walk with the plough and a rifle over our shoulder to defend against murderous Arab raids.</p>
          <p>The settlement would accept only married couples as a single person would not have been able to withhold
            the
            burden.</p>
          <p>So one must find a partner willing to share the labour and the agonies without resentment and carry the
            burden
            in the toughest conditions.</p>
          <p>Shoshana and I were devoted to the zionist ideal of building the country, hold the land, give up on the
            luxurious and not whine.</p>
          <p>We were orphans but we completed one another for almost 60 years.</p>
          <p>We made all the decisions together - regarding both the farm and the children.</p>

          <p>During the 50s there was massive immigration from Africa (Yemen, Marrocco, Aljir, Tunisia), heavy
            recession,
            food ration, scarcity and unemployment but we continued building new villages and towns.</p>
          <p>The spirit was high and everyone wanted to be involved.</p>

          <p>Over time the Arabs were driven off the land and we started cultivating the land more vigorously.</p>

          <p>In the assembly it was decided to split the plots to the different members, but it was a very challenging
            task
            as many of the plots were very wet and nobody wanted them.</p>
          <p>The produce increased and we bought a truck, no longer needing to rely on HaZorea’s truck.</p>

          <p>The Relationships in Yokneam were good and we would meet with friends on Saturday evenings.</p>
          <p>We celebrated all the holidays (in the town hall that was originally built as a garage with permission from
            the
            British) and everyone participated, baked cakes, wore costumes in Purim and marched the fields in Shavuot.
          </p>
          <p>Our financial state was reasonable as well, we had plenty of food but being modest we didn’t buy many

          <p>I placed a water sprinkler on the roof and whenever it got too hot we opened the valve and that cooled down
            the
            houser a bit.</p>
          <p>I later used the same technique on the chicken coops, when we uncaged the chickens.</p>
          <p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khamsin" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">khamsins</a>
            (heat waves) we always had a high mortality rate, losing up to 30 chickens a day.</p>
          <p>We drank from <a href="https://wikibbutz.beeri.org.il/wiki/index.php/%D7%92%27%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%94"
              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jarrah</a> (a clay jug with a small spout that could keep water
            cool
            for up to a week).</p>
          <p>The living conditions were harsh but we were young and paid no heed. We toiled and by evening were
            exhausted
            and slept well.</p>
          <p>I sometimes wonder how we managed to do everything and still have time to read books by the kerosene light.
          </p>

          <p>One time I returned from the field at midday to check on the chickens only to realise that one of the hens
            had
            <a href="https://vetericyn.com/blog/what-is-prolapse-vent-in-chickens" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener">prolapsed</a> (had her insider inverted and pushed out).
          </p>
          <p>There was not much to do with but mercy-killing it and since there was no fridge, the meat was to be used
            straight away.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, Shoshana has taken the children to visit their relatives and I had to rush back to the
            fields.
          </p>
          <p>I quickly skinned it, gave the bones to the dog to chew while I used a manual meat-grinder to pulp the
            chicken
            and mixed it with 6 eggs.</p>
          <p>I sat down to eat this big “chicken-burger” for lunch and then hurried back to work.</p>
          <p>As I said, my appetite was always insatiable.</p>

          <p>At first we had a few goats that supply milk and cheese for the household but the herd grew quickly.</p>
          <p>A state-sponsored guide visited us several times and helped us improve the goat house and the goats’
            produce.
          </p>
          <p>We ended up being certified as “top farm”.</p>
          <p>He also suggested we would join the goat breeder’s association - <a href="https://www.aziza.co.il/"
              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aziza</a> (a wordplay on the Hebrew word for a goat - "Ez").</p>
          <p>We kept a male goat that served many farms and selling lambs gave nice additional income.</p>
          <p>All of our children grew on goat’s milk and lambs’ meat.</p>
          <p>All our goats had names. One day I noticed a goat named Simcha (“Happiness”) had a hard tumor in part of
            her
            udder.</p>
          <p>I sent the family to visit their aunt Edith in Kiryat Amal while I stayed to operate on the goat.</p>
        </section>
      </article>
      <article class="page">
        <section class="page_content">
          <p>I tied her down, took a bottle of Alcohol and had a big gulp.</p>
          <p>Without anesthesia I opened the udder using my (unused) shaving razor blade and took out the hard and big
            tumor.</p>
          <p>I squeezed half a tube of penicillin in and sewed back the cut, smearing the rest of the udder on the
            outside.
          </p>
          <p>She healed well and kept producing milk (from her other udders) and gave birth to many off-springs.</p>
          <p>A state-sponsored vet came to visit and saw the scar and after hearing the story confessed that he would
            never
            have dared to do it.</p>

          <p>As time went by we raised calves who mature to become cows.</p>
          <p>The cowshed was the second brick building I built myself.</p>
          <p>The cows ate large quantities so we also need a barn to store the hay for the winter, which I also built.
          </p>
          <p>Later we built a bigger chicken coop and additional rooms to the house, with the help of Shoshana and our
            four
            children.</p>
          <p>As more settlers joined the village the guard duty became less of a burden.</p>
          <p>After receiving the <a

              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reparations money</a> from the Germans I bought myself a
            tractor.
          </p>
          <p>One day I drove a tractor with a cart to the field and filled it up with hay.</p>

      <article class="page">
        <section class="page_content">
          <p>As I was about to head back I realised I had a flat tyre in one of the cart’s wheels.</p>
          <p>Without other options I planned to leave the cart in the field and go fetch a spare tyre, but as I tried to
            disconnect the cart by pulling the pin holding it to the tractor, it fell and hit my head. I saw the blood
            trickling on my shirt and when touching the side of my head, I could feel the raw flesh and I feared my
            brain
            was spilling out.</p>
          <p>Without a second thought I tore a strip of cloth off the tractor’s seat and wrapped it around my header
            (later
            I tried doing it again but without the adrenalin rush it just wouldn’t tear).</p>
          <p>I drove back to the village straight to the infirmary.</p>
          <p>I sat patiently in the queue until the nurse approached me and asked for the reason for my visit.</p>
          <p>I pointed to my make-shift bandage and she gently unwrapped my head.</p>
          <p>Seeing what was underneath she quickly wrapped it back and hurried to get me a transport to the hospital in
            Haifa.</p>
          <p>I learned that fortunately my brain was spilling, but my ear was hanging on a thin shred of flesh.</p>
          <p>The doctor managed to sew it back and asked me to stay the night for an observation but I told him I should
            probably rush home to catch the last bus before the Sabbath as I still had to milk the cows in the evening.
          </p>
          <p>I ran outside and managed to catch the bus at the last moment.</p>

          <p>Relieved, I sat at the front bench behind the door and as I told the driver my story he got careless and
            bumped
            in a traffic sign that sprayed me with broken glasses.</p>
          <p>I did manage to go home eventually though.</p>
          <p>The hearing in that ear was impaired as the canal healed twistedly and over the year my hearing in the
            other
            ear deteriorated and I used a hearing aid.</p>
          <p>Many years later, the doctor offered to examine the stitched ear and realised that the twisted canal can be
            easily fixed with modern technology, and happily my hearing was restored.</p>

          <h2>Epilogue: Eulogy</h2>
          <p>Shimon Shmuel was born to a small jewish family who traded in textile in Berlin, 1920.</p>
          <p>He was a good student and knew to recite poems in German and French which he remembered to his last days
            and
            showed no tolerance to antisemites, a thing which led to a broken arm after punching a boy in the nose for
            teasing him.</p>
          <p>He worked and helped his family and he, together with his two-years-younger brother, Hillel, scoured the
            basements shafts for lost coins.</p>
          <p>Since their gaze was fixed on the earth, their head kept bumping on the window sills.</p>
          <p>Reaching the age of 14, Shimon was sent by his youth club "HaBonim" to the agricultural training camp "Gut
            Winkel" which was owned by Shokner and in spite he initially wanted to work with actual farming, he spent
            most
            of his time in the workshop where he learned to shoe horses, fix wooden barrels and dismantle tractors (and
            put
            them back together afterwards).</p>
          <p>After two years he moved to a farm operated by teenagers in Griessen, 500 kilometers from Berlin. In this
            farm
            many tricks were played, such as impersonating as the gestapo for newcomers.</p>

          <p>Once he made a bet on the amount of pancakes he can eat, which eventually led to a slap in the face from
            Ilana,
            who stood over the hot pan and at another time he made a bet he could cycle all the way to Berlin in less
            than
            a
            day.</p>
          <p>He eventually won the bet and made one of his rarest visits to this family.</p>

          <p>On December 1937 Shimon sold his bicycle and brought his parents a fat duck as good-bye present before
            going
            to
            Israel.</p>
          <p>His parent, who still believed life in Germany will improve were very sad and his uncle asked him to
            reconsider, arguing that Israel is a desert wasteland with no water and endless wars with the local
            population
            but Shimon did not heed and eventually took the train to Trieste where a boat named "Jerusalem" was about to
            set
            sail.</p>
          <p>As all the teenagers in the training farms, Shimon too was adopted by an Israeli family and that's how he
            came
            to live with the Ruchni family in Kfar Yehoshua.</p>
          <p>At the first day he amazed the father of the family, sowing oatmeal with an ease (actually he brought a
            grinding stone and made sure his harvester was sharp before he started) and thanks to the jam recipes he
            brought
            with him the villager's jam was not burnt for the first time.</p>
          <p>The life in Kfar Yehoshua were lived to the full - with work in the morning and the evening, studying at
            noon
            and guarding at night.</p>
          <p>Shimon, who supervised the guards and made sure they are alert visited all the post every night and that's
            how
            he came to meet Shoshana, his future wife.</p>

          <p>Their wedding was modest, with wild flowers sewn to the bride's gown and cakes the neighbors prepared and
            in
            spite the happiness was great, the party ended rather early as the friends went to sleep in preparation for
            the
            next day's chores.</p>

          <p>Not long after the second world war began.</p>
          <p>The British army asked for volunteers and so Shoshana became a nurse, first in Egypt and later in Italy and
            Shmuel was recruited to the jewish battalion and was sent to dig trenches in Amariya next to Alexandria
            (Egypt).
          </p>
          <p>Later he was sent to unload supplies from boats to a base in Tobruk (Libya) which provided gears for the
            British army in the whole of Africa.</p>
          <p>Shimon, who already knew English by reading "Gone with the wind" with Shoshana was promoted to a rank of
            sergeant.</p>
          <p>After a while, the regiment moved to Kalamata (Greece) but the encountered enemy forces and the british
            army
            began his retreat.</p>
          <p>With no available space on the trucks, Shimon lay on the canvas roof and held the rails tightly for eleven
            hours, after which he required assistance as his entire body ached.</p>
          <p>on the night of their surrender, Shimon and his friends ran into a Yugoslavian truck stocked with money.
          </p>
          <p>They filled the pockets, used some for heating and buried the rest under a tree.</p>

          <p>Years to come, Shimon return to the place, but found a big highway instead of tree and the treasure was
            lost.
          </p>

          <p>The POWs were sent to do various jobs in Germany.</p>
          <p>Speaking German helped Shimon as he took care of his men and the other POW who were with him.</p>
          <p>When a coal cart flipped over, Shimon propsed to flip it back in exchange for a day off for his friends
            (they
            rolled the cart on temporary rails he place at the end of the slope).</p>
          <p>When they met jewish prisoners, the British soldiers gave away their sandwiches.</p>
          <p>The SS soldier raged and turned to hit the jewish prisoners but they German soldier who looked for the POWs
            confronted them and threw their bats and whips to the river.</p>
          <p>When the war was over, Shimon, who suffer from malnutrition as the rest of the prisoners, was sent to
            Britain
            for rehabilitation and after a couple of month he was sent back to Palestine.</p>
          <p>With the discharge money Shimon and Shoshana could buy a small plot of land in the new village of Yokneam,
            where they built their home on top of hill, filled with rocks, thrones and an ever-lasting daily wars with
            snakes and scorpions who had a special kin for cribs.</p>
          <p>They worked the swampy fields in the valley and raised melons and fodder.</p>

          <p>Later, with the aid of the German payments they expanded their farm with four cows at first and later more
            cows
            and a chicken coop.</p>
          <p>His many tales from the farm include how he ate a whole chicken, removed a tumor from a goat's udder and he
            nearly lost his ear when a cart slipped over his head.</p>

          <p>For more then four decades Shimon and Shoshana operated their farmed and raised four children.</p>
          <p>In 1991 they decided to retire and began travelling the world with their children and grandchildren.</p>
          <p>This tradition continued even after Shoshana has succumbed to cancer in 1998.</p>
          <p>In the late of 2011 Shimon's health began to deteriorate and he moved to live in proximity to his daughter
            Marganit.</p>
          <p>On 26.6.2012 Shimon Shmuel passed away, leaving two boys, two girls, thirteen grandchildren, nineteen
            great-grandchildren and collection of teddy bear he received as gifts from all around the world.</p>
          <p>Shimon was loved by all and was known for his witty tales and jokes, his tricks, technical skill,

          <p>The Shmuel family of Yokneam is honoured to invite the Shmuel family of Menahemia to the wedding of their
            son,
            Roni, with his Betrothed Ruhama that will take place June 5th 1954 at the host of his parents.</p>
          <p>Due to his tender age we will have to postpone the wedding for a few years but we will still be delighted
            to
            see (regardless of the wedding) on the said date to Judith’s birthday party.</p>

          <p>We shall wait to pick them up on Friday 9 o’clock’s bus.</p>
          <p>In case no want would arrive on the bus we shall expect all of you throughout the day.</p>
          <p>There’s no need to bring or send any additional clothes for the children as we got plenty.</p>
          <p>They could stay here over the Shavuot holiday and Shoshana will bring them back home.</p>
          <p>We are making big preparations and if you don’t come, it’ll all be ruined as we don’t have a fridge.</p>

          <h3 class="appendix">Teddy</h3>
          <p>During the 50s we used to take the children once a year to a fun day - visiting the zoo in Tel Aviv and
            riding
            the carousel.</p>
          <p>One time we also took them to a toy shop and allowed each child to buy their toys.</p>
          <p>We planned for a big expense as we recently received the <a

              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reparations money</a> from the Germans in compensation for the
            death
            of our parents and we thought the children are entitled to some of it as they didn’t have grandparents.</p>
          <p>They only had toys of our own making such wooden horses or rug-dolls but we wanted to let them buy from
            their
            own choosing.</p>
          <p>They were very modest and picked small things as they weren’t used to spending money.</p>
          <p>The youngest of the bunch picked a thumb-sized teddy-bear he named Amosi he named after his friend, the
            neighbor's son.</p>
          <p>It sat in the pocket of his shirt everywhere he went but when he started going to school the teddy
            disappeared
            and we never saw him again.</p>
          <p>Over the years, and especially after we retired and toured the world, we looked for the bear or anyone like
            him
            in different toy shops but we couldn’t find anyone like Amosi who can turn his head and move his arms and
            legs.

          <p>We got him and I immediately placed him in my shirt.</p>
          <p>I asked the elderly women we met if he’s going to grow and at first they didn’t know what I was talking
            about
            because of my dark shirt but I pointed him out to them and they laughed.</p>
          <p>“No”, they said “As long as he won’t eat vegetables, he will stay small”.</p>

          <p>But thus began the troubles, which were scenes I re-enacted to the entertainment of my guests: how can we
            get
            him across the border as he doesn’t have a passport.</p>
          <p>We smuggled him home but the next day he was placed in jail for trespassing.</p>
          <p>We contacted the German and Swiss embassy to issue documents for him but they replied they don’t have a
            bear
            department.</p>
          <p>Left with no choice, grandchild #10 (out of the 13 granchilden I numbered) issued him an Israeli passport
            and
            got him out of jail.</p>
          <p>The first thing he got was a “bed” that grandchild #11 brought him. Next- #13 brought him a small
            television
            so
            he wouldn’t get bored.</p>
          <p>#6 brought the cousins from America (a bear and lady-bear from McDonalds) to act as his parents and very
            quickly two more relatives arrived and the family grew.</p>

          <p>Everyone who heard of Teddy’s arrival added something to the scene, such as a stone- carving from <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Hazor">Tel Hazor</a> or a picture of three bears in a cave.</p>
          <p>Teddy and his family got a corner on the cupboard and every day the scene changed.</p>
          <p>At first we needed to cross the language barrier as Teddy from Stein Am Rhein spoke German while the
            Mcdonalds-tribe bears spoke English.</p>
          <p>It took a while until they all spoke in Hebrew, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulpan"

          <p>After acclimatizing the real troubles began: Teddy didn’t have any discipline and he did whatever he
            wanted.
          </p>
          <p>He climbed on the pictures and everyone looked for him. He laughed and his parents got upset, but the
            relatives
            tried to make peace.</p>
          <p>But there were also good days when mama-bear spoiled him and papa-bear would take him on the shoulders.</p>
          <p>When my family would visit me every Saturday evening and gather around the table the first question they
            would
            ask was “What has Teddy done this time and tried to interpret the scene the bears reenacted.</p>

          <p>During my 58 years of loving marriage I tried to get rid of my wife several times, as a joke of course.
          </p>
          <p>One time while spending a holiday in London I tried to do away with her by pushing her in front of a
            coming
            bus.</p>
          <p>Alas, I failed to notice the bus was driving on the left side of the road and so she was saved</p>
          <p>Another time we took a cruise and at the breakfast buffet I piled myself an immodest stack of bacon but
            just as I was about to return to the table, the boat's captain stood in my way and ask me to hand him
            the
            plate.</p>
          <p>I was afraid that I was in trouble, but instead he simply carried the plate for me to the dining table.
          </p>
          <p>We chatted a little and I asked if he is authorised to marry people.</p>
          <p>He explained that yes, as we're in international water.</p>
          <p>"In that case", I asked him, "would it be possible for you to divorce us?"</p>
          <p>He was taken by surprise but after giving it some thought he answer that yes, he believes he can
            approve
            our divorce.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, so it seems, the butcher that married us, in Kfar Yehoshua back in 1940, wasn't
            certified to
            conduct wedding and therefore we weren't legally married and couldn't legally divorce.</p>
          <p>We decided to stay together for a bit longer.</p>

          <p>A farmer from a small and faraway village was required to appear at the IRS to sign some papers.</p>
          <p>He woke up early in the morning, before the rooster called, harnessed the horse to the wagon, took the
            sandwiches his wife made him the night before and headed out, for the first time going farther than 10 miles
            from his village.</p>
          <p>The road was long and eventually he arrived at the IRS office just a few moments before they closed at
            sunset.
          </p>
          <p>He signed the documents and asked for direction to the nearest hotel where he could rest for a few hours
            before
            starting his journey back.</p>
          <p>Upon arriving at the hotel he noticed the dining room and decided to take a chance and try their fine
            dining.
          </p>
          <p>He ate like a king and stopped only when he was about to burst, reluctantly leaving the soup after only
            tasting
            a spoonful.</p>

          <p>At night, in the next room a guy lad was suffering from horrendous stomach ache. A doctor was called to
            diagnose and he instructioned the concierge that an anema could ease the pains.</p>
          <p>As he was about to leave, he mentioned that two strong men should be able to hold the contorting patient.
          </p>
          <p>It was by mistake that the men turned to the wrong room and while the two men held the struggling poor
            farmer,
            the concierge provided the treatment as instructed.</p>
          <p>After a short while the farmer got up and without saying a word set off on his way back home.</p>
          <p>When he arrived in the evening, his neighbors came to hear his stories about the big city and he told them
            about the high buildings, the horse-less wagons and about the hotel and the dinner.</p>
          <p>“One thing one must know”, he noted, “you will finish the soup, one way to the other!”</p>

          <p>A rabbi was approached by a Jew who complained he cannot handle his ten children.</p>
          <p>Finance, God willing, is not an issue but the children are noisy, fight all the time and wreak such havoc
            the
            house is never quiet.</p>
          <p>The rabbi thought about it for a moment and then replied: “I don’t know the solution to your problem as the
            lord still hasn't blessed me with ten children but he did bless me with a clever and cheerful goat that
            might
            help reign in your children”.</p>

          <p>The Jew was happy to take the goat and hurried back home.</p>
          <p>The week wasn’t over before he returned the goat and complained- “This goat is a menace! There’s not a
            single
            item in the house she hasn’t broken! Not a single cupboard she has opened and trashed! Not a girl she hasn’t
            chased nor a boy that hasn’t received a bite in bottom from this devilish goat! She’s loud, messy and wreaks
            more chaos than all the children combined! Take her back and let peace be upon Israel!”.</p>
          <p>The rabbi apologised deeply and took back the goat.</p>
          <p>A week has passed and the rabbi met the Jew on his way to the butcher and asked how things are at home.</p>
          <p>The Jew replied “Ah! Now that the goat is out and things are back to normal - the house is quiet, tidy and
            pleasant to be in”.</p>
          <p>The rabbi wondered “And aren’t the children fighting?” and the Jew replied “they fight, that’s the nature
            of
            children, but the house is filled with joy and there’s no dull moment!”</p>

          <p>A farmer one found a technique to train his horse to work without eating.</p>
          <p>Every day he would ration the horse’ meals smaller and smaller and after two weeks he didn’t feed the horse
            at
            all, he decided to call it a success.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the horse died and the farmer went bankrupt before he managed sign the patent for his
            technique.
